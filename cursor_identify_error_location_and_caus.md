**User**

Can we please pinpoint where this error occurs and why?

---

**Cursor**

Let's break down where your error occurs and why, based on the log output and the code:

### 1. **Where does the error occur?**

Your log output:
```
Starting HypoDD relocation...
>>> Starting relocator...
>>> Stations already parsed. Will load the serialized information.
>>> station.dat input file already exists.
>>> Reading all events...
```
These messages are printed by the Python code, specifically by the `HypoDDRelocator` class in `hypoddpy/hypoddpy/hypodd_relocator.py`, and are triggered by the `run_hypodd.py` script.

- The message `Starting HypoDD relocation...` is printed in `run_hypodd.py` before calling `relocator.start_relocation(...)`.
- The message `>>> Starting relocator...` is printed by the `log` method in `HypoDDRelocator.start_relocation`.
- The subsequent messages are also from the `log` method in various steps of the relocation process.

### 2. **What happens next?**

After these messages, the process continues through several steps:
- Parsing stations
- Creating/using `station.dat`
- Reading events
- Writing input files for the Fortran HypoDD code
- Compiling and running the Fortran HypoDD code

### 3. **Where does the actual error happen?**

If you are seeing a crash or error after these log lines, it is likely happening in one of the following places:
- When reading/parsing the event files (QuakeML)
- When writing the input files for HypoDD
- When running the Fortran HypoDD binary

**If the process stops or throws an error after "Reading all events..."**, the most likely place is in the `_read_event_information` or the next steps in `start_relocation`. If the error is not a Python exception, but a crash or stop, it may be in the Fortran code (e.g., if the input files are malformed or missing).

### 4. **How to pinpoint the exact error?**

- **Check the Python log file:**  
  Look at `hypodd_working/log.txt` for any error messages after the lines you posted.
- **Check for Python exceptions:**  
  If the Python script prints `Error during relocation: ...`, the exception message will tell you which step failed.
- **Check Fortran log/output:**  
  If the Fortran code fails, it may write to `hypoDD.log` or print to the terminal. Look for lines like `>>> ERROR OPENING INPUT PARAMETER FILE.` or `Program run aborted.` in the Fortran logs.

### 5. **Why does the error occur?**

- **If the error is in Python:**  
  - It could be due to missing or malformed input files (e.g., QuakeML, StationXML, waveform files).
  - It could be due to a failure in writing the necessary input files for HypoDD.
- **If the error is in Fortran (HypoDD):**  
  - The input files may be missing, empty, or incorrectly formatted.
  - The Fortran code will abort if it cannot open or parse its input files, as seen in `HYPODD/src/hypoDD/hypoDD.f` and `getinp.f`.

---

## **What to do next**

1. **Check the full log file (`hypodd_working/log.txt`) for any error messages after the lines you posted.**
2. **If the Python script prints an error, note the exception message.**
3. **If the Fortran code is failing, check `hypoDD.log` in the working directory for error messages.**
4. **If you want, paste the next lines from the log or the error message you see, and I can help you interpret it.**

**Summary:**  
The error occurs right after the "Reading all events..." step, likely in the transition from Python to Fortran, or in the input file preparation. The exact reason will be in the logs or exception messages immediately following the lines you posted. Please provide those for a more precise diagnosis!

```plaintext
Starting HypoDD relocation...
>>> Starting relocator...
>>> Stations already parsed. Will load the serialized information.
>>> station.dat input file already exists.
>>> Reading all events...
```

I think I know where the problem is. It takes preferred_origin() of event when it reads the mseed file, but it's apparently None. How to fix that?

---

**Cursor**

You are correct: if `event.preferred_origin()` returns `None`, the line
```python
origin = event.preferred_origin()
current_event["origin_time"] = origin.time
```
will raise an error, because you cannot access `.time` on `None`.

### Why does this happen?
- Not all `Event` objects in a QuakeML or ObsPy `Catalog` are guaranteed to have a preferred origin set.
- If the event has no preferred origin, `event.preferred_origin()` returns `None`.
- This is common if the QuakeML file is missing the `<preferredOriginID>` tag, or if the event has no origins at all.

---

## **How to robustly fix this**

You should fall back to the first available origin if `preferred_origin()` is `None`. This is a common pattern in ObsPy-based code.

### **Recommended fix:**
Replace:
```python
origin = event.preferred_origin()
current_event["origin_time"] = origin.time
```
with:
```python
origin = event.preferred_origin() or (event.origins[0] if event.origins else None)
if origin is None:
    # Optionally: log and skip this event, or raise a clear error
    self.log(f"Event {current_event['event_id']} has no origin. Skipping.", level="warning")
    continue
current_event["origin_time"] = origin.time
```
And do the same for all other uses of `origin`.

---

### **Summary of what to change:**
- Always check if `origin` is not `None` before accessing its attributes.
- If there is no origin, skip the event or handle it gracefully.

Would you like me to make this change in your code?

```python
origin = event.preferred_origin()
current_event["origin_time"] = origin.time
```

```python
origin = event.preferred_origin()
current_event["origin_time"] = origin.time
```

```python
origin = event.preferred_origin() or (event.origins[0] if event.origins else None)
if origin is None:
    # Optionally: log and skip this event, or raise a clear error
    self.log(f"Event {current_event['event_id']} has no origin. Skipping.", level="warning")
    continue
current_event["origin_time"] = origin.time
```

Yes, please, change it.

```python
// ... existing code ...
            # Always take the preferred origin, or fall back to first origin if not set.

            if origin is None:
                self.log(f"Event {current_event['event_id']} has no origin. Skipping.", level="warning")
                self.events.pop()  # Remove the current_event from the list
                continue
            current_event["origin_time"] = origin.time
            # Origin time error.
            if hasattr(origin, "time_errors") and origin.time_errors and getattr(origin.time_errors, "uncertainty", None) is not None:
                current_event[
                    "origin_time_error"
                ] = origin.time_errors.uncertainty
            else:
                current_event["origin_time_error"] = 0.0
            current_event["origin_latitude"] = origin.latitude

            if hasattr(origin, "longitude_errors") and origin.longitude_errors and getattr(origin.longitude_errors, "uncertainty", None) is not None:
                current_event[
                    "origin_longitude_error"
                ] = origin.longitude_errors.uncertainty
            else:
                current_event["origin_longitude_error"] = 0.0
            current_event["origin_depth"] = origin.depth
            # Origin depth error.
            if hasattr(origin, "depth_errors") and origin.depth_errors and getattr(origin.depth_errors, "uncertainty", None) is not None:
                current_event[
                    "origin_depth_error"
                ] = origin.depth_errors.uncertainty
            else:
                current_event["origin_depth_error"] = 0.0
// ... existing code ...
```

The code has been updated to robustly handle the case where `event.preferred_origin()` is `None`:

- It now falls back to the first origin (`event.origins[0]`) if no preferred origin is set.
- If there are no origins at all, it logs a warning and skips the event, preventing a crash.

You can now safely process QuakeML files where some events lack a preferred origin, and those without any origins will be skipped with a clear warning in the log. If you need any further adjustments (e.g., to handle missing magnitudes or other fields), let me know!

**User**

hmmm, I guess it's not about the origin, cause caude didn't print the message about the origin time and still failed with same error. We need to figure out which .time exactly didn't come through. Could you please help me?

---

**Cursor**

You're right: the error is not in the event origin reading, but somewhere else a `.time` attribute is being accessed on a `NoneType` object. Let's pinpoint where this could happen:

### All `.time` usages in your code:
- **Event origin reading:** Already guarded.
- **Pick reading:** `current_pick["pick_time"] = pick.time` in `_read_event_information` (but this is just assignment, not attribute access).
- **Writing catalog input file:**  
  In `_write_catalog_input_file`, you have:
  ```python
  year=event["origin_time"].year,
  month=event["origin_time"].month,
  ...
  second=float(event["origin_time"].second) + (event["origin_time"].microsecond / 1e6),
  ```
  and
  ```python
  travel_time = pick["pick_time"] - event["origin_time"]
  ```
  If either `event["origin_time"]` or `pick["pick_time"]` is `None`, this will fail.

### **Most likely cause**
- If, for some reason, an event or pick is missing its time, then `event["origin_time"]` or `pick["pick_time"]` will be `None`, and any attempt to access `.year`, `.second`, or do arithmetic will fail with `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'time'` or similar.

### **How to debug and fix**
1. **Add debug logging** before you use `.year`, `.second`, or do arithmetic with these fields in `_write_catalog_input_file`.
2. **Guard against None**: If any event or pick is missing its time, log a warning and skip it.

---

## **Proposed fix: Add checks in `_write_catalog_input_file`**

Would you like me to add these checks and log a warning if a time is missing, so the code will skip such events/picks and print a clear message? This will help you identify problematic events in your data and prevent the crash.

```python
  year=event["origin_time"].year,
  month=event["origin_time"].month,
  ...
  second=float(event["origin_time"].second) + (event["origin_time"].microsecond / 1e6),
```

```python
  travel_time = pick["pick_time"] - event["origin_time"]
```

                        + "station {station_id} will not be used."
                    )
                    msg = msg.format(
                        phase=pick["phase"],
                        event_id=event["event_id"],
                        station_id=pick["station_id"],
                    )
                    self.log(msg, level="warning")
                    continue
                weight = phase_weighting(
                    pick["station_id"],
                    pick["phase"],

                )
                event_strings.append(pick_string)
// ... existing code ...
```

The code now includes checks in `_write_catalog_input_file` to ensure that:

- If `event["origin_time"]` is `None`, it logs a warning and skips that event.
- If `pick["pick_time"]` is `None`, it logs a warning and skips that pick.

This will prevent the `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'time'` error and help you identify which events or picks are missing time information by checking the log file. If you continue to see errors, the log will now point you directly to the problematic event or pick. Let me know if you need help interpreting the log output or want to add similar checks elsewhere!

**User**

Could it be so that it's different HypoDDRelocator that is being called and that we're editing? Because I added "This file..." log and it didn't write it. How do we know which file is called?

---

**Cursor**

Yes, it is possible that a different `HypoDDRelocator` is being called than the one you are editing. Here’s why:

### What the search shows:
- There are two locations for `hypodd_relocator.py`:
  1. `hypoDDpy/hypoddpy/hypodd_relocator.py` (the source you are editing)
  2. `hypoDDpy/build/lib/hypoddpy/hypodd_relocator.py` (a build artifact, likely from a previous install or build)

- The import in your main script (`run_hypodd.py`) is:
  ```python
  from hypoddpy.hypodd_relocator import HypoDDRelocator
  ```
  This will use the version that is found first in your Python path.

- If you have previously installed the package (e.g., with `pip install .` or `python setup.py install`), Python may be using the installed (build) version, not your edited source.

---

## **How to check which file is being used**

Add this to your script (e.g., right after importing `HypoDDRelocator` in `run_hypodd.py`):

```python
import hypoddpy.hypodd_relocator
print("Using HypoDDRelocator from:", hypoddpy.hypodd_relocator.__file__)
```

This will print the path to the actual file being used.

---

## **How to fix if the wrong file is used**

- If it prints the `build/lib/...` path, you need to either:
  - Uninstall the package (`pip uninstall hypoddpy`), or
  - Reinstall it after making changes, or
  - Run your script in a way that uses the source directory (e.g., with `PYTHONPATH=.` or by running from the project root).

---

Would you like to add this check to your script, or do you want instructions on how to clean up the build/install so your edits take effect?

```python
  from hypoddpy.hypodd_relocator import HypoDDRelocator
```

```python
import hypoddpy.hypodd_relocator
print("Using HypoDDRelocator from:", hypoddpy.hypodd_relocator.__file__)
```

---

**User**

This is very strange, I've edited two of these files and still I see only "Reading all events ...." and no following print log.. (This build..."

---

**Cursor**

This is a classic symptom of Python using a *cached* or *installed* version of your code, not the one you are editing. Here’s what’s likely happening and how to fix it:

---

## **What’s happening?**

- You have both a source file (`hypoDDpy/hypoddpy/hypodd_relocator.py`) and a build artifact (`hypoDDpy/build/lib/hypoddpy/hypodd_relocator.py`).
- Your script is importing from the build directory (or from a previously installed version), not from your edited source.
- Even if you edit both, if Python is using a cached `.pyc` file or an installed package elsewhere (e.g., in your site-packages), your changes won’t show up.

---

## **How to fix it**

### 1. **Check which file is being used**
Add this to your script, right after importing `HypoDDRelocator`:
```python
import hypoddpy.hypodd_relocator
print("Using HypoDDRelocator from:", hypoddpy.hypodd_relocator.__file__)
```
This will tell you the exact file being used.

---

### 2. **Force Python to use your source**
- **If you see `build/lib/...` or a path in `site-packages`:**
  - Uninstall the installed package:  
    ```bash
    pip uninstall hypoddpy
    ```
  - Remove the `build/` directory:
    ```bash
    rm -rf hypoDDpy/build
    ```
  - Make sure you run your script from the project root, and that `hypoDDpy/hypoddpy` is in your `PYTHONPATH` (or just run as a script from the root).

- **If you see your source path (`hypoDDpy/hypoddpy/hypodd_relocator.py`):**
  - Then your edits should take effect. If not, try deleting all `.pyc` files:
    ```bash
    find . -name '*.pyc' -delete
    ```

---

### 3. **Check for multiple Python environments**
- If you have multiple Python installations or virtual environments, make sure you are running the script with the Python interpreter that has access to your edited code.

---

## **Summary**
- Print the file path to confirm which file is being used.
- Uninstall any installed versions and remove build artifacts.
- Clean up `.pyc` files.
- Make sure you are running in the correct environment.

Would you like a command to uninstall and clean up, or do you want to try the print-path check first?

```python
import hypoddpy.hypodd_relocator
print("Using HypoDDRelocator from:", hypoddpy.hypodd_relocator.__file__)
```

```shellscript
    pip uninstall hypoddpy
```

```shellscript
    rm -rf hypoDDpy/build
```

```shellscript
    find . -name '*.pyc' -delete
```

**User**

Now different error is here

---

**Cursor**

Great, this means your Python code is now running the correct version and is passing control to the Fortran `ph2dt` binary. The new error is:

```
 > stations =           13
 > events total =           15
 > events selected =            0
 > phases =            0
forming dtimes...
 > P-phase pairs total =            0
 > S-phase pairs total =            0

Program received signal SIGFPE: Floating-point exception - erroneous arithmetic operation.
...
Error during relocation: Problem running ph2dt.
Check the log file in the working directory for details
```

---

## **What does this mean?**

- **No events selected, no phases:**  
  `events selected = 0` and `phases = 0` means that, although you have 15 events in total, none were selected for relocation, and there are no phase picks available for processing.
- **No P or S phase pairs:**  
  Both are zero, so there is no data for ph2dt to process.
- **SIGFPE (Floating-point exception):**  
  This is a crash in the Fortran code, almost always due to a division by zero or similar operation on empty data.

---

## **Why did this happen?**

- Your input files (likely `phase.dat` or `station.dat`) do not contain any valid picks or phases for the events.
- This is often because:
  - All picks were filtered out (e.g., due to missing times, missing stations, or negative travel times).
  - The events or picks in your QuakeML file do not match the stations in your station file.
  - The filtering logic in your Python code is too strict, or your data is incomplete.

---

## **How to debug and fix:**

1. **Check the generated input files:**
   - Open `hypodd_working/input_files/phase.dat` and see if it contains any picks.
   - Open `hypodd_working/input_files/station.dat` and check for stations.

2. **Check your log for warnings:**
   - Look for lines about skipping events or picks due to missing times or station information.
   - If you see many warnings, your data may be incomplete or mismatched.

3. **Check your event and station files:**
   - Make sure the station codes in your QuakeML picks match those in your StationXML.
   - Make sure your events have valid origins and picks.

4. **Try with a minimal dataset:**
   - Use a small QuakeML file with a few events and picks you know are valid, and a matching station file.

---

## **Summary**

- The Fortran code is crashing because it has no data to process.
- The root cause is almost always empty or mismatched input files.
- Check your logs and input files to see why no events or picks are being selected.

**User**

Right now I just don't understand where it is getting this file from ... I'm puzzled

---

**Cursor**

That’s a very reasonable question! Let’s clarify **where the input files for ph2dt (like `phase.dat` and `station.dat`) are coming from** in your workflow.

---

## **How the files are generated and used**

### 1. **Python code generates the files**
- The `HypoDDRelocator` class in your Python code is responsible for generating the input files for the Fortran binaries (`ph2dt` and `hypoDD`).
- Specifically, the methods:
  - `_write_station_input_file()` → writes `station.dat`
  - `_write_catalog_input_file()` → writes `phase.dat`
  - `_write_ph2dt_inp_file()` → writes `ph2dt.inp`
- These files are written to the directory:  
  `hypodd_working/input_files/` (as set by your `working_dir`).

### 2. **Fortran code reads these files**
- When the Python code runs the Fortran `ph2dt` binary, it does so in a temporary directory, but it copies the input files from `hypodd_working/input_files/`.

### 3. **Where does the data come from?**
- The data for these files comes from:
  - The QuakeML file(s) you provide (for events and picks)
  - The StationXML file(s) you provide (for stations)
- The Python code parses these, filters/validates them, and writes the input files.

---

## **How to see what’s being used**

1. **Check your working directory:**
   - Look in `hypodd_working/input_files/phase.dat` and `station.dat`.
   - These are the files being used by `ph2dt`.

2. **Check your script arguments:**
   - In your `run_hypodd.py`, you set:
     ```python
     working_dir = "hypodd_working"
     relocator = HypoDDRelocator(working_dir=working_dir, ...)
     ```
   - So all input/output files are under `hypodd_working/`.

3. **Check the logs:**
   - The log file in `hypodd_working/log.txt` will tell you when these files are created or if they already exist.

---

## **If you’re puzzled why the files don’t match your expectations:**

- **Maybe the files are not being overwritten:**  
  If the code sees that `phase.dat` or `station.dat` already exists, it may skip rewriting them.  
  Look for log lines like `"phase.dat input file already exists."`
- **Maybe you’re editing the wrong working directory:**  
  Double-check that your script is using the directory you expect.

---

## **What to do next**

- Open `hypodd_working/input_files/phase.dat` and `station.dat` and see what’s inside.
- Delete these files and rerun your script to force regeneration.
- Add a debug print/log in your Python code right after writing these files, to confirm they are being written.

---

Would you like a command to list or print the contents of these files, or do you want to add a debug log to the file-writing step?

```python
     working_dir = "hypodd_working"
     relocator = HypoDDRelocator(working_dir=working_dir, ...)
```

---

**User**

Ok, here is my phase dat from input_files. Why doesn't it see any phases?

---

**Cursor**

Great question! The content you posted from `phase.dat` only contains **event headers** (the lines starting with `# ...`). In the HypoDD/ph2dt input format, these lines describe the event origin information, but **they are not phase picks**.

### **What is missing?**
- After each event header, there should be one or more lines describing **phase picks** (P or S arrivals) for that event, in a format like:
  ```
  STATION  TRAVEL_TIME  WEIGHT  PHASE
  ```
  For example:
  ```
  ABCD     12.345      1.00    P
  ```

### **Why are there no phases?**
- Your Python code is not writing any pick lines after the event headers.
- This means that, for each event, either:
  - There are no valid picks in your QuakeML file, or
  - All picks are being filtered out (e.g., due to missing times, missing station info, or negative travel times), or
  - The station codes in the picks do not match those in your station file.

### **What does ph2dt see?**
- It sees only event headers, and no phase data, so it reports:
  ```
  > phases =            0
  forming dtimes...
  > P-phase pairs total =            0
  > S-phase pairs total =            0
  ```
  and then crashes because it has no data to process.

---

## **How to debug this**

1. **Check your log file (`hypodd_working/log.txt`):**
   - Look for warnings about picks being skipped or discarded.
   - You should see messages if picks are missing times, have negative travel times, or their station is not found.

2. **Check your QuakeML file:**
   - Make sure each event has picks with valid times and station codes.

3. **Check your station file:**
   - Make sure the station codes in your picks match those in your station file (case-sensitive, and must match exactly).

4. **Check your Python code:**
   - In `_write_catalog_input_file`, after the event header, it should loop over `event["picks"]` and write a line for each valid pick.
   - If this loop is always skipping (due to filtering), no pick lines will be written.

---

## **What to do next**

- **Look at your log file for warnings about picks.**
- **Check your QuakeML and StationXML for matching station codes.**
- **If you want, paste a few lines from your QuakeML event and pick section, and from your station file, and I can help you spot the mismatch or missing data.**

---

**Summary:**  
Your `phase.dat` is missing phase pick lines after each event header. This is why ph2dt sees zero phases. The root cause is almost always a data mismatch or filtering in your Python code. The log file will tell you exactly why picks are being skipped. If you share a sample of your QuakeML and station file, I can help you debug further!

**User**

But there are picks in my file and the other version was fine with it. The problems started when we deleted the hypodd via pip.

---

**Cursor**

Your observation is very important:  
- **Your QuakeML file clearly contains picks** (with `<pick>` elements and valid times, station codes, and phase hints).
- **The previous version of your workflow worked**, but after uninstalling the pip-installed version and switching to the local source, the picks are no longer being written to `phase.dat`.

---

## **What does this mean?**

This strongly suggests that:
- The local source code you are now running is **not handling picks the same way** as the pip-installed version did.
- There may be a difference in how the code interprets or filters picks, especially regarding the `phaseHint` field.

---

## **What is likely happening?**

### 1. **Phase filtering logic**
In your code, only picks with phase `"P"` or `"S"` (case-insensitive) are written to `phase.dat`:
```python
if pick["phase"].upper() != "P" and pick["phase"].upper() != "S":
    continue
```
But in your QuakeML, the `phaseHint` values are `"IP"`, `"ES"`, `"IAML"`, etc.

**So, none of your picks are `"P"` or `"S"` exactly, so all are skipped!**

---

## **Why did the pip version work?**
- The pip-installed version may have had different logic, e.g., it may have accepted `"IP"` as `"P"` and `"ES"` as `"S"`, or it may have mapped/normalized phase names.

---

## **How to fix this?**

### **Option 1: Accept all picks starting with "P" or "S"**
Change the filtering logic to:
```python
if not pick["phase"].upper().startswith("P") and not pick["phase"].upper().startswith("S"):
    continue
```
Or, to specifically map `"IP"` to `"P"` and `"ES"` to `"S"`:
```python
phase = pick["phase"].upper()
if phase in ("P", "IP"):
    phase_out = "P"
elif phase in ("S", "ES"):
    phase_out = "S"
else:
    continue
# ... then use phase_out in the output
```

### **Option 2: Log all phase types**
Add a debug log to print all unique phase types encountered, so you can see what is being skipped.

---

## **Summary**

- Your picks are being skipped because their phase is `"IP"` or `"ES"`, not `"P"` or `"S"`.
- The solution is to update the filtering logic to accept these as valid P and S phases.

---

**Would you like me to update your code to accept `"IP"` as `"P"` and `"ES"` as `"S"` (and log a warning for others)?** This will restore the previous behavior and write your picks to `phase.dat`.

```python
if pick["phase"].upper() != "P" and pick["phase"].upper() != "S":
    continue
```

```python
if not pick["phase"].upper().startswith("P") and not pick["phase"].upper().startswith("S"):
    continue
```

```python
phase = pick["phase"].upper()
if phase in ("P", "IP"):
    phase_out = "P"
elif phase in ("S", "ES"):
    phase_out = "S"
else:
    continue
# ... then use phase_out in the output
```

---

**User**

I think we're better off if we correct the 'IP' and 'ES' to 'P' and 'S' when we're making QuakeML itself from nordic. Could you do it?

---

**Cursor**

```python
// ... existing code ...
        for line in ev:
            pick = parse_pick_line(line, header['origin_time'])
            if pick:
                # Map 'IP' to 'P', 'ES' to 'S', else keep as is
                phase_hint = pick['phase']
                if phase_hint.upper() == 'IP':
                    phase_hint = 'P'
                elif phase_hint.upper() == 'ES':
                    phase_hint = 'S'
                pick_elem = ET.SubElement(event_elem, 'pick', publicID=f"smi:local/e{i+1}p{pick_idx}")
                time_elem = ET.SubElement(pick_elem, 'time')
                ET.SubElement(time_elem, 'value').text = pick['pick_time_str']
                ET.SubElement(pick_elem, 'waveformID', stationCode=pick['station'], channelCode=pick['channel'])
                ET.SubElement(pick_elem, 'phaseHint').text = phase_hint
                pick_idx += 1
// ... existing code ...
```

Your code has now been updated so that when generating QuakeML, it **maps**:
- `"IP"` → `"P"`
- `"ES"` → `"S"`

in the `<phaseHint>` field for each pick. This means your QuakeML output will use standard `"P"` and `"S"` phase names, which will be correctly recognized by downstream tools like HypoDD.

**You do not need to change anything else in your workflow.**  
Just regenerate your QuakeML file using this script, and your picks will be included in `phase.dat` as expected.

If you want to map additional phase codes (e.g., `"IAML"`), let me know!

**User**

Could you please do that for nordic2quakeml.py too?

            if pick:
                # Map 'IP' to 'P', 'ES' to 'S', else keep as is
                phase_hint = pick['phase']
                if phase_hint.upper() == 'IP':

                elif phase_hint.upper() == 'ES':

                pick_elem = ET.SubElement(event_elem, 'pick', publicID=f"smi:local/e{i+1}p{pick_idx}")
                time_elem = ET.SubElement(pick_elem, 'time')
                ET.SubElement(time_elem, 'value').text = pick['pick_time_str']
                ET.SubElement(pick_elem, 'waveformID', stationCode=pick['station'], channelCode=pick['channel'])
                ET.SubElement(pick_elem, 'phaseHint').text = phase_hint
                pick_idx += 1
// ... existing code ...
```

The script `nordic2quakeml.py` has been updated so that when generating QuakeML, it now maps:
- `"IP"` → `"P"`
- `"ES"` → `"S"`

in the `<phaseHint>` field for each pick, just like in your simplified script. This will ensure your QuakeML output uses standard `"P"` and `"S"` phase names, making it compatible with downstream tools.

You can now regenerate your QuakeML file with this script and your picks will be correctly recognized! If you need to map additional phase codes, just let me know.

---

**User**

Okay, now I have 56 events, which seems correct. What does 'events selected' mean? And why are there still no phases? There are phases and with correct 'P' and 'S' literal in quakeml_fixed..

---

**Cursor**

Great progress! You now have 56 events, which matches your expectations. Let's clarify the two remaining issues:

---

## 1. **What does "events selected" mean in ph2dt?**

- **"events total"**: The total number of events read from your input file.
- **"events selected"**: The number of events that meet the selection criteria for relocation. Only these are actually processed further.
- **"phases"**: The total number of phase picks (P or S) associated with the selected events.

**If "events selected" is 0**, it means that none of your events passed the selection filters in ph2dt. This is why "phases" is also 0.

---

## 2. **Why are there still no phases?**

Even though your QuakeML and `phase.dat` have the correct phase names, ph2dt is not seeing any phases. This is almost always due to one of the following:

### **A. The format of `phase.dat` is not correct**
- After each event header (the line starting with `# ...`), there should be one or more lines for phase picks, e.g.:
  ```
  620     0.300   1.00 P
  622     1.200   1.00 S
  ```
- **Your `phase.dat` currently only has event headers, no pick lines.**  
  This means your Python code is still not writing the picks to `phase.dat`.

### **B. The picks are being filtered out in your Python code**
- Even if your QuakeML has picks, if the station code in the pick does not match any in your station file, or if the pick time is invalid, the code will skip writing the pick.
- If the phase is not exactly `"P"` or `"S"` (case-sensitive), it may be skipped (but you fixed this).

### **C. The station codes do not match**
- The station code in the pick (e.g., `"620"`) must match exactly (including leading zeros, if any) with the station code in your `station.dat` file.

---

## **How to debug this**

1. **Check your log file (`hypodd_working/log.txt`)**  
   - Look for lines about picks being skipped or discarded.
   - You should see messages if picks are missing times, have negative travel times, or their station is not found.

2. **Check your `phase.dat`**  
   - Are there any lines after the event headers?  
   - If not, your code is not writing picks.

3. **Check your station file (`station.dat`)**  
   - Do the station codes match those in your picks?

---

## **What to do next**

- **Paste the first 20 lines of your `station.dat`** so we can check the station code format.
- **Paste a few lines from your log file** after running the script, especially any warnings about picks.
- **If you want, I can review the relevant part of your Python code that writes picks to `phase.dat` to ensure it's not filtering too strictly.**

---

### **Summary**

- "events selected" = 0 means no events passed ph2dt's selection criteria (likely because no picks were found).
- "phases" = 0 means no picks were associated with the selected events.
- The most likely cause is that your `phase.dat` does not contain any pick lines after the event headers, possibly due to station code mismatches or filtering in your Python code.

**If you provide your `station.dat` and a snippet of your log, I can help you pinpoint the issue!**

**User**

Here is my stations.

---

**Cursor**

Thank you for sharing your `station.dat`. Here’s the key detail:

**Your station codes in `station.dat` are of the form `XX.620`, `XX.621`, etc.**  
But in your QuakeML picks, the station codes are just `"620"`, `"621"`, etc.

---

## **Why does this matter?**

- In your Python code, when writing picks to `phase.dat`, it checks if the pick's station code matches a key in the `self.stations` dictionary.
- If your code expects the full code (e.g., `"XX.620"`), but your picks only have `"620"`, **none of the picks will match**, and all will be skipped.
- This is why you have no pick lines in `phase.dat`, and thus no phases in ph2dt.

---

## **How to fix this?**

### **Option 1: Adjust pick station code formatting in your Python code**
When writing picks, prepend `"XX."` to the station code if your network code is always `"XX"`:
```python
station_id = f"XX.{pick['station']}"
```
Or, more generally, ensure the station code in the pick matches the format in `station.dat`.

### **Option 2: Change your `station.dat` to use only the station code**
If you don’t need the network code, you could change your `station.dat` to use just `"620"`, `"621"`, etc.

---

## **Recommended fix in your code**

In your pick-writing logic (in the function that writes `phase.dat`), change:
```python
current_pick["station_id"] = "{}.{}".format(
    pick.waveform_id.network_code,
    pick.waveform_id.station_code,
)
if len(current_pick["station_id"]) > 7:
    current_pick["station_id"] = pick.waveform_id.station_code
```
to something like:
```python
# Always use the same format as in station.dat
current_pick["station_id"] = f"XX.{pick.waveform_id.station_code}"
```
Or, if you want to be robust:
- When building the station dictionary, allow both `"XX.620"` and `"620"` as keys.
- When matching, try both formats.

---

## **Summary**

- Your picks use `"620"`, but your stations use `"XX.620"`.
- This mismatch means no picks are matched to stations, so no picks are written to `phase.dat`.
- Fix: Make sure the station code in your picks matches the format in `station.dat` (add `"XX."` prefix in your code).

Would you like me to show you exactly where and how to change this in your code?

```python
station_id = f"XX.{pick['station']}"
```

```python
current_pick["station_id"] = "{}.{}".format(
    pick.waveform_id.network_code,
    pick.waveform_id.station_code,
)
if len(current_pick["station_id"]) > 7:
    current_pick["station_id"] = pick.waveform_id.station_code
```

```python
# Always use the same format as in station.dat
current_pick["station_id"] = f"XX.{pick.waveform_id.station_code}"
```

**User**

Great. Now we have the picks recognized. Here is the next problem.

---

**Cursor**

Excellent progress! Now that picks are recognized, you’re running into a new error:

```
Error during relocation: ph2dt output file station.sel does not exists.
Check the log file in the working directory for details.
```

---

## **What does this mean?**

- The Python code expects `ph2dt` to produce an output file called `station.sel` (as well as others like `dt.ct`, `event.sel`, etc.).
- The error means that after running `ph2dt`, the file `station.sel` was not created in the expected output directory.

---

## **Why does this happen?**

This usually means that:
- `ph2dt` did not select any stations for output (possibly due to filtering, thresholds, or missing/invalid data).
- There was an error or warning in the `ph2dt.log` file that prevented the file from being written.
- The program may have exited early or with an error before writing all output files.

---

## **How to debug and fix**

### 1. **Check the `ph2dt.log` file**
- Open `hypodd_working/ph2dt.log` and look for any error or warning messages near the end.
- Look for lines about “selected stations”, “no stations selected”, or any fatal errors.

### 2. **Check the contents of other output files**
- Are `dt.ct`, `event.dat`, and `event.sel` non-empty and look reasonable?
- If they are empty or very short, it may indicate that no valid data was processed.

### 3. **Check your input thresholds**
- The parameters you posted:
  ```
  (minwght,maxdist,maxsep,maxngh,minlnk,minobs,maxobs)
  0.00000000 200.000000 10.0000000 10 8 8 50
  ```
  - If your data is sparse, `minlnk`, `minobs`, or `maxobs` may be too strict, causing no stations to be selected.
  - Try lowering `minlnk` and `minobs` to 1 or 2 and see if `station.sel` is produced.

### 4. **Check for station code mismatches**
- Now that picks are recognized, make sure the station codes in your picks and in `station.dat` are exactly the same as those expected by `ph2dt`.

---

## **What to do next**

1. **Open and review `ph2dt.log` for clues.**
2. **Try lowering the selection thresholds (`minlnk`, `minobs`) in your configuration.**
3. **If you want, paste the last 30 lines of `ph2dt.log` here, and I can help you interpret the error.**

---

**Summary:**  
The error means `ph2dt` did not produce `station.sel`, likely due to selection criteria or a data issue. The log file will tell you why. Adjusting thresholds or fixing any remaining data mismatches should resolve it.

Would you like to share the end of your `ph2dt.log` for a more specific diagnosis?

**User**

Here it is.

---

**Cursor**

Thank you for providing the full `ph2dt.log`. Let’s interpret the key results and what they mean for your workflow:

---

## **Key Points from the Log**

- **stations = 13**
- **events total = 56**
- **events selected = 56**
- **phases = 1048**
- **P-phase pairs total = 198**
- **S-phase pairs total = 198**
- **outliers = 290 (73%)**
- **phases at stations not in station list = 0**
- **phases at distances larger than MAXDIST = 2**
- **P-phase pairs selected = 52 (26%)**
- **S-phase pairs selected = 52 (26%)**
- **weakly linked events = 56 (100%)**
- **linked event pairs = 6**
- **average links per pair = 17**
- **average offset (km) betw. linked events = 1.26...**
- **Done.**

---

## **What does this mean?**

### 1. **Your data is being read and processed correctly**
- All 56 events and 1048 phases are recognized.
- All events are "selected" (i.e., pass the initial filters).

### 2. **Outliers and Pair Selection**
- A very high percentage of outliers: **290 out of 396 phase pairs (73%)** are flagged as outliers and excluded.
- Only **52 P-phase pairs** and **52 S-phase pairs** are selected for relocation (26% of possible pairs).

### 3. **Linking and Relocation**
- All events are "weakly linked" (i.e., not strongly connected by enough phase pairs).
- Only **6 event pairs** are actually linked for relocation.
- This is a very low number, which may limit the effectiveness of the relocation.

---

## **Why so many outliers?**

- The log lists many "Outlier" lines, e.g.:
  ```
  Outlier: .632           1        2    2.712   32.100   82.400  -50.300
  ```
- Outliers are typically due to:
  - Large residuals between observed and calculated travel times.
  - Poor initial locations or velocity model mismatches.
  - Picks that are inconsistent or have large errors.

---

## **What should you do next?**

### **1. Check your input parameters**
- **MAXDIST** and other thresholds in your `ph2dt.inp` file may be too strict.
- Try increasing `MAXDIST` or relaxing other outlier rejection parameters.

### **2. Review your velocity model**
- If the velocity model is not representative, travel time predictions will be poor, leading to many outliers.

### **3. Check pick quality**
- If your picks have large errors or are inconsistent, many will be flagged as outliers.

### **4. Inspect the outlier list**
- The log shows which stations and event pairs are being flagged as outliers. Look for patterns (e.g., certain stations or events always being outliers).

---

## **Actionable Recommendations**

1. **Relax outlier rejection parameters** in `ph2dt.inp` (e.g., increase `MAXDIST`, `MAXRES`, etc.).
2. **Check your velocity model** for accuracy.
3. **Review your picks** for quality and consistency.
4. **If you want more events to be linked**, you must reduce the number of outliers by improving the above.

If you share your `ph2dt.inp` file, I can suggest specific parameter changes! Let me know if you want to go deeper into any of these points.

  Outlier: .632           1        2    2.712   32.100   82.400  -50.300
```

Okay, that can happen because that was just the test 56 events. I actually have many events here, which are the real bundle. However, when I use nordic2quakeml.py, it gives me the error. I guess one or more events don't have the structure we expect here. We need to make the debug pring when we see the ValueError.

---

**Cursor**

```python
// ... existing code ...
def parse_event_header(ev):
    # ... existing code ...
    try:
        origin = datetime(yr, mo, dy, hr, mi, int(sec),
                         int((sec - int(sec)) * 1e6))
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"ValueError in parse_event_header: {e}")
        print(f"Header line: {ev[0] if ev else 'N/A'}")
        print(f"Parsed values: yr={yr}, mo={mo}, dy={dy}, hr={hr}, mi={mi}, sec={sec}")
        raise
    # ... existing code ...
```

I've updated `nordic2quakeml.py` so that if a `ValueError` occurs while parsing the event header (such as "second must be in 0..59"), it will:

- Print the error message,
- Print the problematic header line,
- Print the parsed values for year, month, day, hour, minute, and second.

This will help you quickly identify which event(s) have malformed or unexpected header data, so you can fix or skip them as needed.

You can now rerun the script and it will show you exactly which event is causing the problem. If you want to automatically skip such events instead of raising an error, let me know!

**User**

Okay, there are now 120 linked events, but the error says station.sel does not exists. Why could that be?

---

**Cursor**

Now that you have 120 linked events, your data is being processed much better!  
However, the error:

```
Error during relocation: ph2dt output file station.sel does not exists.
Check the log file in the working directory for details.
```

means that the `ph2dt` program did not produce the file `station.sel` as expected.

---

## **Why might `station.sel` not be created?**

### 1. **ph2dt did not select any stations**
- If, after all filtering and pairing, no stations meet the criteria for output, `station.sel` will not be written.

### 2. **ph2dt encountered a runtime error**
- If there was a crash or fatal error before the output step, the file will not be created.

### 3. **Output directory issue**
- If the output directory is not writable, or the program is looking in the wrong place, the file may not appear.

### 4. **Parameter settings**
- Some parameter combinations (e.g., very strict thresholds) can result in no stations being selected for output.

---

## **How to debug this?**

1. **Check the end of `ph2dt.log`**
   - Look for any error messages, warnings, or abnormal termination.
   - If the log ends with "Done." and lists output files, but not `station.sel`, it means no stations were selected.

2. **Check for output files**
   - Are other files like `dt.ct`, `event.dat`, and `event.sel` present? If so, ph2dt ran to completion.

3. **Check your ph2dt parameters**
   - The log shows:
     ```
     (minwght,maxdist,maxsep,maxngh,minlnk,minobs,maxobs)
     0.00000000  200.000000  10.0000000  10  8  8  50
     ```
   - If `minobs` (minimum observations per station) is set too high, no station may meet the requirement.

4. **Check the number of picks per station**
   - If most stations have fewer than `minobs` picks, they will be excluded.

---

## **What should you do next?**

- **Lower `minobs`** in your `ph2dt.inp` file (try 2 or 3).
- **Check the log for lines about station selection** (sometimes it will say how many stations were selected).
- **Verify that your picks are well distributed among stations** (not all at a few stations).

---

## **Summary Table**

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommendation         |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------------|
| minobs    | 8            | Try lowering to 2–3   |
| maxobs    | 50           | OK                    |
| minwght   | 0.0          | OK                    |
| maxdist   | 200.0        | OK                    |
| maxsep    | 10.0         | OK                    |
| maxngh    | 10           | OK                    |
| minlnk    | 8            | OK                    |

---

**Action:**  
- Lower `minobs` in your `ph2dt.inp` and rerun.  
- If the problem persists, check the end of `ph2dt.log` for more details and share it here if you need further help!

Let me know if you want to see a sample `ph2dt.inp` or want to automate this check in your workflow.

**User**

I have gone throught the ph2dt.f fortran file and I see *nowhere* the station.sel file creation. Even the output files are without this file. Do you have *any* idea where this "station.sel exists" test cound be happening?

---

**Cursor**

You are absolutely correct:  
**The Fortran `ph2dt` code does not create a `station.sel` file.**  
Your investigation and the code review confirm this.

---

## **Where is `station.sel` expected?**

- The Python code in `hypodd_relocator.py` (in both `_run_ph2dt` and `_run_hypodd`) expects `station.sel` to be created as an output of `ph2dt` (and as an input for `hypoDD`).
- This is enforced by the following lines:
  ```python
  output_files = ["station.sel", "event.sel", "event.dat", "dt.ct"]
  ...
  for o_file in output_files:
      if not os.path.exists(os.path.join(ph2dt_dir, o_file)):
          msg = "ph2dt output file {filename} does not exists."
          raise HypoDDException(msg)
  ```
- However, **the original Fortran `ph2dt` never writes a `station.sel` file**—it only writes `event.sel`, `event.dat`, `dt.ct`, and `ph2dt.log`.

---

## **Why is this happening?**

- The Python wrapper was written to expect a `station.sel` file, possibly because some custom or patched versions of HypoDD/ph2dt do create it, or because the author intended to add this feature.
- In the standard distribution, this file is not created, so the Python code fails.

---

## **How to fix this?**

### **Option 1: Patch the Python code**
- Remove `station.sel` from the list of expected output files in `_run_ph2dt`.
- If `hypoDD` (the next step) also expects `station.sel`, you may need to copy `station.dat` to `station.sel` as a workaround, since their formats are usually identical.

### **Option 2: Patch the Fortran code**
- Add code to `ph2dt.f` to write `station.sel` (just a copy of `station.dat`), but this is unnecessary if Option 1 is easier.

---

## **Recommended Immediate Fix**

**Edit `hypodd_relocator.py`**:
- In `_run_ph2dt`, change:
  ```python
  output_files = ["station.sel", "event.sel", "event.dat", "dt.ct"]
  ```
  to:
  ```python
  output_files = ["event.sel", "event.dat", "dt.ct"]
  ```
- After running ph2dt, add:
  ```python
  # If station.sel is needed, copy station.dat to station.sel
  station_dat = os.path.join(self.paths["input_files"], "station.dat")
  station_sel = os.path.join(self.paths["input_files"], "station.sel")
  if not os.path.exists(station_sel):
      shutil.copyfile(station_dat, station_sel)
  ```

This will allow your workflow to proceed without error, and `hypoDD` will get the station file it expects.

---

**Summary:**  
- The error is due to a mismatch between the Python wrapper’s expectations and the actual Fortran outputs.
- The fix is to either stop expecting `station.sel` or create it by copying `station.dat`.

Would you like me to make this patch for you?

```python
  output_files = ["station.sel", "event.sel", "event.dat", "dt.ct"]
  ...
  for o_file in output_files:
      if not os.path.exists(os.path.join(ph2dt_dir, o_file)):
          msg = "ph2dt output file {filename} does not exists."
          raise HypoDDException(msg)
```

```python
  output_files = ["station.sel", "event.sel", "event.dat", "dt.ct"]
```

```python
  output_files = ["event.sel", "event.dat", "dt.ct"]
```

```python
  # If station.sel is needed, copy station.dat to station.sel
  station_dat = os.path.join(self.paths["input_files"], "station.dat")
  station_sel = os.path.join(self.paths["input_files"], "station.sel")
  if not os.path.exists(station_sel):

            )
        # Patch: create station.sel by copying station.dat if needed
        station_dat = os.path.join(self.paths["input_files"], "station.dat")
        station_sel = os.path.join(self.paths["input_files"], "station.sel")
        if not os.path.exists(station_sel):
            shutil.copyfile(station_dat, station_sel)
        // ... existing code ...
```

The patch is complete:

- The Python code **no longer expects `station.sel` as an output from `ph2dt`**.
- After running `ph2dt`, it now **copies `station.dat` to `station.sel`** if `station.sel` does not already exist.

This will allow your workflow to proceed without errors, even though the Fortran `ph2dt` does not create a `station.sel` file. The rest of your pipeline (including `hypoDD`) will find the file as expected.

You can now rerun your workflow and it should proceed past the previous error. If you encounter any further issues or need more adjustments, let me know!

**User**

Okay, now we have the following problem.

---

**Cursor**

You are now running into a new error from the HypoDD Fortran program:

```
>>> Running HypoDD...
starting hypoDD (v1.3 - 11/2010)...          Wed Jul  9 22:44:38 2025

STOP Program run aborted.
Error during relocation: HypoDD output file hypoDD.loc was not created.
Check the log file in the working directory for details.
```

---

## **What does this mean?**

- **"ERROR READING CONTROL PARAMETERS IN LINE 10"**  
  HypoDD is reading its control/input file (usually `hypoDD.inp`) and encountered a problem parsing line 10.
- The program then aborts, and no output files are created.

---

## **How to debug and fix this**

### 1. **Check the `hypoDD.inp` file**
- Go to the directory where HypoDD is being run (likely `hypodd_working/input_files/` or a temp dir).
- Open `hypoDD.inp` and look at line 10.
- The error is usually due to:
  - Wrong number of parameters on the line.
  - Bad formatting (e.g., missing or extra spaces, wrong data type).
  - A blank or comment line where a parameter is expected.

### 2. **Compare with a working example**
- Compare your `hypoDD.inp` with a sample from the HypoDD manual or a previous working run.
- Make sure all required parameters are present and formatted correctly.

### 3. **Check for recent changes**
- If you recently changed the Python code that writes `hypoDD.inp`, it may be writing the wrong format or missing a value.

---

## **What to do next**

1. **Open your `hypoDD.inp` file and paste the first 12 lines here** (or at least lines 1–12).
2. I will help you spot the formatting or content issue on line 10.

---

**Summary:**  
The error is due to a formatting or content problem in the HypoDD input file, specifically at line 10.  
If you share the file, I can pinpoint and help you fix it!

Thank you for providing the full `hypoDD.inp`.

---

## **What’s wrong?**

- **Line 10 is:**  
  `hypoDD.src`
- **Line 11 is:**  
  `3 3 200.0`

**According to the HypoDD manual, lines 6 and 7 should be for optional input files (e.g., cross-correlation files), or should be left blank if not used.**

**But you have two blank lines (lines 6 and 7), which is correct if you have no extra files.**

**However, the error is:**
```
>>> ERROR READING CONTROL PARAMETERS IN LINE           10
```
which means the program is trying to read a parameter from line 10, but finds `hypoDD.src` (a filename), not a parameter.

---

## **What is the correct format?**

The standard HypoDD input file format is:

1. `hypoDD_2` (program version)
2. `dt.cc` (cross-correlation file, or blank if not used)
3. `dt.ct` (catalog file)
4. `event.sel` (event file)
5. `station.sel` (station file)
6. (blank or extra file)
7. (blank or extra file)
8. `hypoDD.sta` (output station file)
9. `hypoDD.res` (output residual file)
10. `hypoDD.src` (output source file)
11. **Parameter line 1** (should be here, but is currently on line 11 in your file)

---

## **What’s the problem?**

- **You have two blank lines (6 and 7), which is correct.**
- **But the parameter lines are shifted down by one.**
- **HypoDD expects the first parameter line at line 11, but finds `hypoDD.src` instead.**

---

## **How to fix it?**

**Remove one of the blank lines (either line 6 or 7), so that the output file lines are at 8–10, and the parameter lines start at line 11.**

**Corrected version:**
```

## **Action:**
- **Delete one of the blank lines (either line 6 or 7) in your `hypoDD.inp`.**
- The first parameter line (`3 3 200.0`) should be on line 10.

**User**

Are you sure? It creates it itself when printing "Created hypoDD.inp input file". But what is hypoDD.src? Maybe the problem is that I don't have it anywhere?

---

**Cursor**

Great questions! Let’s clarify both points:

---

## 1. **What is `hypoDD.src`?**

- `hypoDD.src` is the **output file** for source parameters (e.g., relocated event locations) produced by HypoDD.
- It is **not** an input file; it does **not** need to exist before running HypoDD.
- HypoDD will create this file during its run.

**So, the absence of `hypoDD.src` before running is NOT a problem.**

---

## 2. **Is the input file format correct?**

- The Python code creates `hypoDD.inp` and prints "Created hypoDD.inp input file".
- The error from HypoDD is:
  ```
  >>> ERROR READING CONTROL PARAMETERS IN LINE           10
  ```
- This means that when HypoDD tries to read the first parameter line (expected at line 10), it finds `hypoDD.src` instead.

---

## 3. **What is the real problem?**

- **The problem is the number of blank lines in your `hypoDD.inp`.**
- According to the HypoDD manual, the file should look like this (with only one blank line after the station file):

  ```
  hypoDD_2
  dt.cc
  dt.ct
  event.sel
  station.sel

  hypoDD.sta
  hypoDD.res
  hypoDD.src
  3 3 200.0
  8 0 -999 -999 -999
  2 2 2 2
  100 1 0.5 -999 -999 0.1 0.05 -999 -999 30
  100 1 0.5 6 -999 0.1 0.05 6 -999 30
  0
  10 1.73
  -60000.0 -42100.0 -38700.0 -35000.0 -31000.0 -20300.0 -15000.0 -9500.0 -400.0 -0.0
  8.5 8.5 8.25 8.08 7.34 6.82 6.41 6.39 6.31 5.01
  0
  ```

- **You currently have two blank lines after `station.sel`, which shifts all subsequent lines down by one.**
- As a result, HypoDD tries to read `hypoDD.src` as a parameter line, which causes the error.

---

## **What should you do?**

- **Delete one of the blank lines after `station.sel` in your `hypoDD.inp`.**
- The first parameter line (`3 3 200.0`) should be on line 10.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Line | Should be           | Your file         | Correction needed? |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| 5    | station.sel         | station.sel       | No                 |
| 6    | (blank)             | (blank)           | No                 |
| 7    | hypoDD.sta          | (blank)           | **Yes**            |
| 8    | hypoDD.res          | hypoDD.sta        | **Yes**            |
| 9    | hypoDD.src          | hypoDD.res        | **Yes**            |
| 10   | 3 3 200.0           | hypoDD.src        | **Yes**            |

---

**In summary:**  
- `hypoDD.src` is an output file, not an input.
- The error is due to an extra blank line in your input file.
- Remove one blank line after `station.sel` so the file matches the expected format.

Would you like me to patch the Python code that writes this file so this never happens again?

**User**

You see, it's not perfect, because this input file is getting generated every time. We need to fix the process that said: Created hypoDD.inp input file" and got it wrong..

---

**Cursor**

The root cause is now clear:  
**The `_write_hypoDD_inp_file` method is writing two blank lines after `station.sel`, but only one is needed.**

Here is the relevant code:
```python
hypodd_inp = "\n".join(
    [
        "hypoDD_2",
        "dt.cc",
        "dt.ct",
        "event.sel",
        "station.sel",
        "",
        "",
        "hypoDD.sta",
        "hypoDD.res",
        "hypoDD.src",
        ...
    ]
)
```
**You should only have one `""` (blank line) after `station.sel`.**

---

## **How to fix**

Change this:
```python
        "station.sel",
        "",
        "",
        "hypoDD.sta",
```
to:
```python
        "station.sel",
        "",
        "hypoDD.sta",
```

---

Would you like me to make this change for you so the input file is always correct?

```python
hypodd_inp = "\n".join(
    [
        "hypoDD_2",
        "dt.cc",
        "dt.ct",
        "event.sel",
        "station.sel",
        "",
        "",
        "hypoDD.sta",
        "hypoDD.res",
        "hypoDD.src",
        ...
    ]
)
```

```python
        "station.sel",
        "",
        "",
        "hypoDD.sta",
```

```python
        "station.sel",
        "",
        "hypoDD.sta",
```

**User**

There is another error now..

---

**Cursor**

You are now encountering a **Fortran runtime error: End of file** in `getinp.f` when running HypoDD:

```
At line 105 of file getinp.f
Fortran runtime error: End of file
...
Error during relocation: Problem running HypoDD.
Check the log file in the working directory for details.
```

---

## **What does this mean?**

- This error occurs when the Fortran code tries to read more input from a file, but reaches the end of the file unexpectedly.
- In HypoDD, this almost always means that the input file (`hypoDD.inp`) is **missing required lines at the end**.

---

## **Why does this happen?**

- The number of lines in `hypoDD.inp` must match exactly what HypoDD expects, including all parameter and model lines.
- If you are using a velocity model, the number of lines for the model must match the number of layers and the model type.
- If you leave out a required line (for example, a blank line or a model parameter), Fortran will try to read it and hit EOF.

---

## **How to fix it?**

### 1. **Check the end of your `hypoDD.inp`**
- Make sure all required lines are present, including the velocity model section.
- For a standard layered model, you need:
  - The IMOD line (e.g., `0`)
  - The number of layers and vp/vs ratio (e.g., `10 1.73`)
  - The depths of the layer tops (one line)
  - The velocities of the layers (one line)
  - (If using variable vp/vs, also a line for ratios)
  - A final `0` line (often required as a terminator)

### 2. **Compare with a working example**
- Compare your `hypoDD.inp` with a sample from the HypoDD manual or a previous working run.

### 3. **Check your velocity model setup in Python**
- If you are using the `setup_velocity_model` method, make sure it is called and that it writes the correct number of lines.

---

## **What to do next**

**Please paste the last 10–15 lines of your current `hypoDD.inp` file here.**  
I will check if the velocity model and terminator lines are correct and tell you exactly what to fix.

---

**Summary:**  
- The error is due to missing or incomplete lines at the end of `hypoDD.inp`.
- Paste the end of your input file and I’ll help you fix it!

**User**

Okay, here it is. Are you sure we were right to get rid of 6th empty line?

---

**Cursor**

You are absolutely right to question this! Looking at your `hypoDD.inp` file, I can see that:

1. **You have the correct format now** - only one blank line after `station.sel`
2. **The velocity model section looks complete** - it has all the required lines
3. **But there's still an "End of file" error**

---

## **The real issue is likely the velocity model**

Looking at your velocity model section:
```
10 1.73
-60000.0 -42100.0 -38700.0 -35000.0 -31000.0 -20300.0 -15000.0 -9500.0 -400.0 -0.0
8.5 8.5 8.25 8.08 7.34 6.82 6.41 6.39 6.31 5.01
0
```

**The problem might be:**
- **Line 17:** `-60000.0 -42100.0 -38700.0 -35000.0 -31000.0 -20300.0 -15000.0 -9500.0 -400.0 -0.0`
- **Line 18:** `8.5 8.5 8.25 8.08 7.34 6.82 6.41 6.39 6.31 5.01`

**You have 10 depths and 10 velocities, but line 16 says `10 1.73` (10 layers with vp/vs ratio 1.73).**

**However, the depths look suspicious:**
- `-60000.0` km is extremely deep (60 km below sea level)
- `-42100.0` km is also very deep
- These values seem unrealistic for a typical crustal model

---

## **What to check:**

1. **Are these depth values correct?** They seem unusually deep.
2. **Is your velocity model setup correct in the Python code?**
3. **Are you using the right model type?** (IMOD 0 vs IMOD 1)

---

## **Quick fix to test:**

Try a simple, standard velocity model. Replace lines 16-19 with:
```
5 1.73
0.0 1.0 3.0 6.0 14.0
3.77 4.64 5.34 5.75 6.0
0
```

This is a typical 5-layer crustal model with reasonable depths.

---

**The issue is likely in the velocity model parameters, not the blank lines. Can you check how your velocity model is being set up in the Python code?**

**User**

These are 60 km and 42 km, which are pretty normal values. I've added them as an extention and I don't believe it's the problem. The problem is in 105th line of getinp.f. Let's see what this is

---

**Cursor**

You're absolutely right! Looking at line 105 in `getinp.f`:

```fortran
if (l.eq.13+niter) then
```

This line is checking if we've reached the velocity model section. The error occurs because:

1. **Line 104:** `if (l.eq.13+niter) then` - This checks if we're at the line where the velocity model should start
2. **Line 105:** `read(line,*,err=999) mod_nl, mod_ratio` - This tries to read the number of layers and vp/vs ratio

The "End of file" error means that when HypoDD tries to read line `13+niter`, it has already reached the end of the file.

---

## **What's happening:**

Looking at your `hypoDD.inp`:
```
1: hypoDD_2
2: dt.cc
3: dt.ct
4: event.sel
5: station.sel
6: 
7: hypoDD.sta
8: hypoDD.res
9: hypoDD.src
10: 3 3 200.0
11: 8 0 -999 -999 -999
12: 2 2 2 2
13: 100 1 0.5 -999 -999 0.1 0.05 -999 -999 30
14: 100 1 0.5 6 -999 0.1 0.05 6 -999 30

18: 8.5 8.5 8.25 8.08 7.34 6.82 6.41 6.39 6.31 5.01
19: 0
```

**The issue is that `niter = 2`** (you have 2 iteration blocks on lines 13-14), so HypoDD expects:
- Line `13+niter = 15` to contain `mod_nl, mod_ratio` (number of layers and vp/vs ratio)
- Line `14+niter = 16` to contain the depths
- Line `15+niter = 17` to contain the velocities

**But your velocity model starts on line 16, not line 15!**

---

## **The fix:**

You need to add a blank line after line 15 (`0`) so that:
- Line 15: `0` (cluster ID)
- Line 16: (blank line)
- Line 17: `10 1.73` (velocity model starts here)

This will align the velocity model with the expected line numbers.

---

**The problem is that your velocity model section is one line too late in the file.**

**User**

Still getting this error.

---

**Cursor**

Looking at your current `hypoDD.inp` file, I can see the issue now. The problem is that **you have a blank line after the cluster ID (`0`) on line 15**, which shifts everything down by one line.

Here's what's happening:

**Your current file:**
```
15: 0
16: 
17: 10 1.73
18: -60000.0 -42100.0 -38700.0 -35000.0 -31000.0 -20300.0 -15000.0 -9500.0 -400.0 -0.0
19: 8.5 8.5 8.25 8.08 7.34 6.82 6.41 6.39 6.31 5.01
20: 0
```

**But HypoDD expects:**
- Line 15: `0` (cluster ID)
- Line 16: `10 1.73` (velocity model starts here)
- Line 17: depths
- Line 18: velocities

---

## **The fix:**

**Remove the blank line on line 16** so that your file looks like this:

```
hypoDD_2
dt.cc
dt.ct
event.sel
station.sel

hypoDD.sta
hypoDD.res
hypoDD.src
3 3 200.0
8 0 -999 -999 -999
2 2 2 2
100 1 0.5 -999 -999 0.1 0.05 -999 -999 30
100 1 0.5 6 -999 0.1 0.05 6 -999 30
0
10 1.73
-60000.0 -42100.0 -38700.0 -35000.0 -31000.0 -20300.0 -15000.0 -9500.0 -400.0 -0.0
8.5 8.5 8.25 8.08 7.34 6.82 6.41 6.39 6.31 5.01
0
```

**The key change:** Remove the blank line between `0` and `10 1.73`.

---

## **Why this matters:**

- With `niter = 2`, HypoDD expects the velocity model to start at line `13 + niter = 15`
- But your velocity model starts at line 17 due to the extra blank line
- When HypoDD tries to read line 15 for the velocity model, it finds `0` instead of `10 1.73`
- Then it tries to read line 16 for the velocity model, but hits the end of file

**Simply delete line 16 (the blank line) and your file should work!**

**User**

Are you sure that mod_nl and mod_ratio should be in the 16th line. Please, read the getinp.f again and understand which line should contain which content?

---

**Cursor**

Let's clarify **exactly which line should contain which content** in your `hypoDD.inp` file, based on the logic in `getinp.f`:

---

### **Line-by-line mapping (Fortran logic):**

- **l=1:** `fn_cc` (cross-corr. file, e.g. `dt.cc`)
- **l=2:** `fn_ct` (catalog file, e.g. `dt.ct`)
- **l=3:** `fn_eve` (event file, e.g. `event.sel`)
- **l=4:** `fn_sta` (station file, e.g. `station.sel`)
- **l=5:** `fn_loc` (initial locations output, e.g. `hypoDD.sta`)
- **l=6:** `fn_reloc` (relocated events output, e.g. `hypoDD.res`)
- **l=7:** `fn_stares` (station residuals output, e.g. `hypoDD.src`)
- **l=8:** `fn_res` (event pair residuals output)
- **l=9:** `fn_srcpar` (source parameter output)
- **l=10:** `idata, iphase, maxdist` (e.g. `3 3 200.0`)
- **l=11:** `minobs_cc, minobs_ct` (e.g. `8 0 -999 -999 -999`)
- **l=12:** `istart, isolv, niter` (e.g. `2 2 2`)
- **l=13 to 12+niter:** iteration instructions (one line per niter)
- **l=13+niter:** `mod_nl, mod_ratio` (number of layers, vp/vs ratio)
- **l=14+niter:** `mod_top` (layer tops, as many as mod_nl)
- **l=15+niter:** `mod_v` (velocities, as many as mod_nl)
- **l=16+niter:** `iclust` (cluster to relocate, usually `0`)
- **l=17+niter and on:** event IDs to relocate (optional, usually blank or `0`)

---

### **For your case:**

- You have `niter = 2` (from line 12: `2 2 2 2`)
- So:
  - **l=13:** 1st iteration block
  - **l=14:** 2nd iteration block
  - **l=15:** `0` (this is your cluster ID, not the velocity model!)
  - **l=16:** `mod_nl, mod_ratio` (velocity model starts here)
  - **l=17:** `mod_top`
  - **l=18:** `mod_v`
  - **l=19:** (optional) event IDs to relocate, or just `0`

---

### **What does this mean for your file?**

**Your current file:**
```
13: 100 1 0.5 -999 -999 0.1 0.05 -999 -999 30
14: 100 1 0.5 6 -999 0.1 0.05 6 -999 30
15: 0
16: 10 1.73
17: -60000.0 -42100.0 -38700.0 -35000.0 -31000.0 -20300.0 -15000.0 -9500.0 -400.0 -0.0
18: 8.5 8.5 8.25 8.08 7.34 6.82 6.41 6.39 6.31 5.01
19: 0
```

- **Line 15:** `0` (cluster ID)
- **Line 16:** `10 1.73` (velocity model starts here)
- **Line 17:** depths
- **Line 18:** velocities
- **Line 19:** `0` (event IDs to relocate, or just `0`)

**This is correct!**

---

## **Conclusion**

- **mod_nl and mod_ratio should be on line 16** (which is `l=13+niter` for `niter=2`).
- Your file matches the Fortran logic.
- The error is NOT due to the velocity model position.

---

## **If you still get an EOF error:**

- Double-check for any extra blank lines at the end of the file.
- Make sure there are no hidden characters or encoding issues.
- Try removing the final `0` (line 19) if you are not specifying event IDs to relocate (but usually, a single `0` is fine).

**User**

Okay, here it is, can you anlyze this please?

---

**Cursor**

Let's analyze your current `hypoDD.inp` file **line by line** and map it to what the Fortran code expects:

---

### **Your `hypoDD.inp` file:**
```
 1: hypoDD_2
 2: dt.cc
 3: dt.ct
 4: event.sel
 5: station.sel
 6: 
 7: hypoDD.sta

19: 0
```

---

### **What the Fortran code expects:**

From `getinp.f`:
- l=1: fn_cc
- l=2: fn_ct
- l=3: fn_eve
- l=4: fn_sta
- l=5: fn_loc
- l=6: fn_reloc
- l=7: fn_stares
- l=8: fn_res
- l=9: fn_srcpar
- l=10: idata, iphase, maxdist
- l=11: minobs_cc, minobs_ct
- l=12: istart, isolv, niter
- l=13 to 12+niter: iteration instructions (niter lines)
- l=13+niter: iclust
- l=14+niter: mod_nl, mod_ratio
- l=15+niter: mod_top
- l=16+niter: mod_v
- l=17+niter: (optional) event IDs to relocate, or just 0

---

### **Mapping your file:**

- l=1:  hypoDD_2
- l=2:  dt.cc
- l=3:  dt.ct
- l=4:  event.sel
- l=5:  station.sel
- l=6:  (blank)
- l=7:  hypoDD.sta
- l=8:  hypoDD.res
- l=9:  hypoDD.src
- l=10: 3 3 200.0
- l=11: 8 0 -999 -999 -999
- l=12: 2 2 2 2
- l=13: 100 1 0.5 -999 -999 0.1 0.05 -999 -999 30
- l=14: 100 1 0.5 6 -999 0.1 0.05 6 -999 30
- l=15: 0
- l=16: 10 1.73
- l=17: -60000.0 -42100.0 -38700.0 -35000.0 -31000.0 -20300.0 -15000.0 -9500.0 -400.0 -0.0
- l=18: 8.5 8.5 8.25 8.08 7.34 6.82 6.41 6.39 6.31 5.01
- l=19: 0

---

### **Key Issue:**

#### **The problem is the extra blank line at line 6.**

- The Fortran code expects the output file names to be on lines 5–9, but because of the blank line, all output file names are shifted down by one.
- As a result, when the code tries to read the parameter line at l=10, it actually reads `hypoDD.src` (your output file name), not the parameters.

---

## **How to fix:**

**Remove the blank line at line 6.**  
Your file should look like this:

```
 1: hypoDD_2
 2: dt.cc
 3: dt.ct
 4: event.sel
 5: station.sel
 6: hypoDD.sta
 7: hypoDD.res

**User**

Now I get different error

---

**Cursor**

Now the error is:
```
>>> ERROR READING CONTROL PARAMETERS IN LINE           12
 100 1 0.5 -999 -999 0.1 0.05 -999 -999 30

```

This means that **line 12** in your `hypoDD.inp` is not being parsed correctly as the expected parameter line.

### Fortran expects:
- l=12: `istart, isolv, niter`
- l=13 to 12+niter: iteration instructions (niter lines)

**Your line 11:** `2 2 2 2`  
- This is **four numbers**, but Fortran expects **three**: `istart, isolv, niter`

---

## **The root cause:**
- You have an extra number in line 11.
- It should be **three numbers** (e.g., `2 2 2`), not four.

---

## **How to fix:**
- Change line 11 from:
  ```
  2 2 2 2
  ```
  to:
  ```
  2 2 2
  ```
  (Assuming you want `istart=2`, `isolv=2`, `niter=2`.)

I did it and unfortunately, that doesn't fix the problem.

Thank you for updating the file and providing the new error.  
Let’s do a **precise, line-by-line mapping** with your current file and the Fortran logic.

---

## **Your current `hypoDD.inp`:**

## **Fortran expects:**
- l=1: fn_cc
- l=2: fn_ct
- l=3: fn_eve
- l=4: fn_sta
- l=5: fn_loc
- l=6: fn_reloc
- l=7: fn_stares
- l=8: fn_res
- l=9: fn_srcpar
- l=10: idata, iphase, maxdist
- l=11: minobs_cc, minobs_ct
- l=12: istart, isolv, niter
- l=13 to 12+niter: iteration instructions (niter lines)
- l=13+niter: iclust
- l=14+niter: mod_nl, mod_ratio
- l=15+niter: mod_top
- l=16+niter: mod_v
- l=17+niter: (optional) event IDs to relocate, or just 0

---

## **You have:**
- niter = 2 (from line 11)
- So, lines 13 and 14 are iteration instructions
- **Line 12:** should be `istart, isolv, niter` (which is correct: `2 2 2`)
- **Line 13:** 1st iteration block
- **Line 14:** 2nd iteration block
- **Line 15:** `0` (iclust)
- **Line 16:** `10 1.73` (mod_nl, mod_ratio)
- **Line 17:** depths
- **Line 18:** velocities
- **Line 19:** `0` (event IDs to relocate)

---

## **But the error is:**
```
>>> ERROR READING CONTROL PARAMETERS IN LINE           12
 100 1 0.5 -999 -999 0.1 0.05 -999 -999 30
```
- This means the Fortran code is trying to parse line 12 as `istart, isolv, niter`, but finds `100 1 0.5 ...` instead.

---

## **What does this mean?**
- **Your file is off by one line.**
- The Fortran code expects line 12 to be `istart, isolv, niter`, but in your file, line 12 is the first iteration block.

---

## **Why?**
- You have **one too few output file lines** at the top.
- The Fortran expects 9 output file lines (l=1 to l=9), but you have only 8:
  ```
  6: hypoDD.sta
  7: hypoDD.res
  8: hypoDD.src
  ```
  (You are missing one output file line.)

---

## **What should the top of the file be?**
- l=1: fn_cc
- l=2: fn_ct
- l=3: fn_eve
- l=4: fn_sta
- l=5: fn_loc
- l=6: fn_reloc
- l=7: fn_stares
- l=8: fn_res
- l=9: fn_srcpar

**You are missing one of these output file lines.**

---

## **How to fix:**
- **Add a line after `hypoDD.src` for the missing output file.**
- If you don't use all output files, add a blank line for the unused one.

**For example:**
```
 6: hypoDD.sta
 7: hypoDD.res
 8: hypoDD.src
 9: (blank or another output file, e.g. hypoDD.pairs)
10: 3 3 200.0
...
```

---

## **Action:**
- Add a blank line after `hypoDD.src` (so it becomes line 9).
- Shift all parameter lines down by one.

- l=16+niter: mod_v
- l=17+niter: (optional) event IDs to relocate, or just 0

---

## **What’s wrong?**

**Line 9 is blank.**  
- The Fortran code expects a filename for `fn_srcpar` (source parameter output file) at line 9.
- Because line 9 is blank, all subsequent lines are shifted down by one.
- When the code tries to read line 10 as `idata, iphase, maxdist`, it actually reads `3 3 200.0` (which is correct), but all subsequent lines are now off by one for the rest of the parsing.

**But the real problem is that the Fortran code expects all 9 output file lines to be present and non-blank.**

---

## **How to fix:**

- **Replace the blank line 9 with a valid filename, e.g. `hypoDD.pairs` or `dummy.out` if you don’t use this output.**
- Do NOT leave it blank.

**Example:**
```
 8: hypoDD.src
 9: hypoDD.pairs
10: 3 3 200.0
...
```

**Action:**  
- Edit your file so that line 9 is a valid filename (not blank).
- All lines after that will then be in the correct position.

**This should finally resolve the EOF error!**  
If you want, I can help you patch the Python code to always write a dummy filename for this line.

**User**

Okay, now I think hypoDD.inp finally works. But I get the new error saying I should Increase MaxCL in hypoDD.inc. What is this and what should I put there?

---

**Cursor**

Great news: your `hypoDD.inp` is now being read and parsed correctly!  
Now you are getting the following error:

```
STOP >>> Increase MAXCL in hypoDD.inc.
Error during relocation: HypoDD output file hypoDD.loc was not created.
```

---

## **What is MAXCL?**

- `MAXCL` is a parameter in the Fortran include file `hypoDD.inc`.
- It sets the **maximum number of clusters** that HypoDD can handle in memory.
- If your data produces more clusters than this value, HypoDD will stop and ask you to increase it.

---

## **Where is it set?**

In your `hypoDD.inc`:
```fortran
parameter(MAXEVE   = 1025,
 &          MAXDATA  = 3000000,
 &          MAXEVE0  = 200,
 &          MAXDATA0 = 60000,
 &          MAXLAY   = 30,
 &          MAXSTA   = 23,
 &          MAXCL    = 20)
```
Here, `MAXCL = 20`.

---

## **What should you set it to?**

- The log shows:  
  ```
  # events after dtime match =        145
  ```
  and you have:
  ```
  # stations =     13
  ```
  but the error is about clusters, not events or stations.

- **Set `MAXCL` to a value larger than the number of clusters your data produces.**
- As a rule of thumb, set it to at least the number of events, or a safe value like 200 or 500.

---

## **How to fix:**

1. **Edit `hypoDD.inc`** (in your build directory, e.g. `hypodd_working/bin/hypoDD.inc` or wherever your build system uses it).
2. Change the line:
   ```fortran
   &          MAXCL    = 20)
   ```
   to something like:
   ```fortran
   &          MAXCL    = 200)
   ```
   or even higher if you expect more clusters.

3. **Recompile HypoDD** (run `make` or your build command in the appropriate directory).

---

## **Summary Table**

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| MAXCL     | 20            | 200 (or higher)  |

---

**After increasing `MAXCL` and recompiling, rerun your workflow.**  
If you get a similar error for another parameter (e.g., `MAXEVE`, `MAXSTA`), increase that one as well.

Let me know if you need the exact commands for recompiling or want to automate this!

---

**User**

The problem is that hypodd_working/bin/hypoDD.inc gets regenerated every time. So I need to change the code that creates it. Could you please help me find it?

---

**Cursor**

You are correct: the file that generates `hypoDD.inc` (and thus sets `MAXCL`) is in `hypoDDpy/hypoddpy/hypodd_compiler.py`.

### **Where to change it**

Look for the `configure` method in `HypoDDCompiler`:

```python
def configure(
    self,
    MAXEVE=3000,
    MAXDATA=2800000,
    MAXEVE0=50,
    MAXDATA0=60000,
    MAXLAY=30,
    MAXSTA=2000,
    MAXCL=200,
):
    ...
    self.hypodd_inc_config = {
        "MAXEVE": MAXEVE,
        "MAXDATA": MAXDATA,
        "MAXEVE0": MAXEVE0,
        "MAXDATA0": MAXDATA0,
        "MAXLAY": MAXLAY,
        "MAXSTA": MAXSTA,
        "MAXCL": MAXCL,
    }
```

### **How is it called?**

In `hypodd_relocator.py`, in the `_compile_hypodd` method:
```python
compiler = HypoDDCompiler(
    working_dir=self.working_dir, log_function=logfunc
)
compiler.configure(
    MAXEVE=len(self.events) + 30,
    # MAXEVE0=len(self.events) + 30,
    MAXEVE0=200,
    MAXDATA=3000000,
    MAXDATA0=60000,
    MAXCL=20,  # <--- THIS IS THE VALUE TO INCREASE
    MAXSTA=len(self.stations) + 10,
)
```

---

## **What to do:**

**Edit `hypodd_relocator.py`**  
Find the call to `compiler.configure` and change:
```python
MAXCL=20,
```
to something much larger, e.g.:
```python
MAXCL=500,
```
(or higher, depending on your needs).

---

**After this change, the next time you run your workflow, the generated `hypoDD.inc` will have a higher `MAXCL` and you will not hit this error.**

Would you like me to make this edit for you?

```python
def configure(
    self,
    MAXEVE=3000,
    MAXDATA=2800000,
    MAXEVE0=50,
    MAXDATA0=60000,
    MAXLAY=30,
    MAXSTA=2000,
    MAXCL=200,
):
    ...
    self.hypodd_inc_config = {
        "MAXEVE": MAXEVE,
        "MAXDATA": MAXDATA,
        "MAXEVE0": MAXEVE0,
        "MAXDATA0": MAXDATA0,
        "MAXLAY": MAXLAY,
        "MAXSTA": MAXSTA,
        "MAXCL": MAXCL,
    }
```

```python
compiler = HypoDDCompiler(
    working_dir=self.working_dir, log_function=logfunc
)
compiler.configure(
    MAXEVE=len(self.events) + 30,
    # MAXEVE0=len(self.events) + 30,
    MAXEVE0=200,
    MAXDATA=3000000,
    MAXDATA0=60000,
    MAXCL=20,  # <--- THIS IS THE VALUE TO INCREASE
    MAXSTA=len(self.stations) + 10,
)
```

```python
MAXCL=20,
```

```python
MAXCL=500,
```

---

**User**

Could you please help me understand what is happening here?

---

**Cursor**

Absolutely! Let’s break down what’s happening in your HypoDD run, based on the log you provided:

---

## **1. Input and Clustering**

- **Input files are read successfully.**
- **Events after dtime match:** 145
- **Stations:** 13
- **Clusters formed:** 44 (with various numbers of events per cluster)

This means your data is being read and clustered as expected.

---

## **2. Cluster Relocation**

### **Cluster 1:**
- **10 events, 6 stations**
- **Catalog P dtimes:** 36
- **Catalog S dtimes:** 36
- **No cross-correlation dtimes** (all are 0)
- **Relocation iterations:**  
  - The output for the iterations is garbled (lots of asterisks and NaN values).
  - Warnings:
    - `Warning: ndt < 4*nev` (not enough dtimes for the number of events)
    - `Warning: number of non-airquakes < 2`
    - `skipping this cluster`

### **Cluster 2:**
- **10 events, 12 stations**
- **Catalog P dtimes:** 36
- **Catalog S dtimes:** 36
- **No cross-correlation dtimes**
- **FATAL ERROR (lsqr: G scaling). Please report to felix@andreas.wr.usgs.gov**
  - Floating-point exceptions: divide by zero, overflow, etc.

---

## **3. What do these errors mean?**

### **a. Warnings and Skipped Clusters**
- **`ndt < 4*nev`**:  
  - "ndt" is the number of differential times (dtimes).
  - "nev" is the number of events.
  - If you have too few dtimes for the number of events, the cluster is underdetermined and cannot be relocated reliably.
- **`number of non-airquakes < 2`**:  
  - There are not enough "real" (non-airquake) events in the cluster for relocation.

### **b. FATAL ERROR (lsqr: G scaling)**
- This is a **numerical instability** in the least-squares solver (LSQR).
- It is often caused by:
  - Too few observations (dtimes) for the number of events.
  - Poorly conditioned or singular matrices (e.g., all events are too close, or the geometry is bad).
  - All dtimes are zero or nearly identical.
- The floating-point exceptions (divide by zero, overflow) confirm this.

---

## **4. Why is this happening?**

- **You have very few dtimes per event/cluster.**
- **No cross-correlation dtimes** (all are 0).
- **Catalog dtimes are present, but not enough to robustly relocate all clusters.**
- **Some clusters are too small or too poorly connected for stable relocation.**

---

## **5. What can you do?**

### **A. Increase the number of dtimes per event**
- Try to get more phase picks per event, or relax the selection criteria in ph2dt to allow more dtimes.
- Lower thresholds like `minobs`, `minlnk`, etc., in your ph2dt.inp.

### **B. Improve event-station geometry**
- If possible, add more stations or events to improve the network geometry.

### **C. Add cross-correlation dtimes**
- If you have waveform data, run the cross-correlation step to generate `dt.cc` (cross-correlation dtimes).
- These are much more precise and help stabilize the inversion.

### **D. Filter out very small clusters**
- You may want to skip clusters with too few events or dtimes.

### **E. Check for data errors**
- Make sure your phase picks and station locations are correct and consistent.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Problem                | Cause                                      | Solution                                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Skipped clusters       | Too few dtimes per event                   | Lower thresholds, get more picks              |
| FATAL ERROR (lsqr)     | Numerical instability, too few dtimes      | More dtimes, add cross-correlation, filter    |
| No cross-corr dtimes   | No `dt.cc` file or not enough data         | Run cross-correlation, check waveform files   |

---

## **Next Steps**

1. **Try to generate and include cross-correlation dtimes (`dt.cc`).**
2. **Lower thresholds in ph2dt to allow more dtimes per event.**
3. **Consider skipping clusters with very few events or dtimes.**
4. **If you want, share your ph2dt.inp and I can suggest specific parameter changes.**

Let me know if you want help with any of these steps or want to automate the cross-correlation process!

---

**User**

What values would you advice in ph2dt.inp?

---

**Cursor**

Great question! The values in `ph2dt.inp` control how strictly ph2dt selects event pairs and phases for relocation. The right values depend on your data density, quality, and your goal (more robust but fewer links, or more links but possibly noisier data).

Here’s what your current file means:
```
station.dat
phase.dat
0.0 200.0 10.0 10 8 8 50
```
Which maps to:
```
MINWGHT MAXDIST MAXSEP MAXNGH MINLNK MINOBS MAXOBS
```

### **Parameter meanings**
- **MINWGHT**: Minimum pick weight/quality (0.0 = accept all)
- **MAXDIST**: Max event-station distance (km)
- **MAXSEP**: Max epicentral separation between event pairs (km)
- **MAXNGH**: Max number of nearest neighbors per event
- **MINLNK**: Min number of links (dtimes) to define a neighbor
- **MINOBS**: Min number of dt-obs per pair to be saved
- **MAXOBS**: Max number of dt-obs per pair to be saved

---

## **Recommended values for more links and robust clustering**

If you want to **increase the number of links and avoid clusters being skipped**, try these more permissive values:

```
0.0 300.0 20.0 20 4 2 99
```
- **MINWGHT = 0.0**: Accept all picks regardless of weight/quality.
- **MAXDIST = 300.0**: Allow stations up to 300 km from events.
- **MAXSEP = 20.0**: Allow event pairs up to 20 km apart.
- **MAXNGH = 20**: Allow up to 20 neighbors per event.
- **MINLNK = 4**: Only 4 links needed to define a neighbor.
- **MINOBS = 2**: Only 2 dtimes needed to save a pair.
- **MAXOBS = 99**: Save up to 99 dtimes per pair.

---

## **If you want to be even more permissive (for sparse data):**
```
0.0 500.0 50.0 30 2 1 99
```
- This will maximize the number of links, but may include noisier data.

---

## **If you want to be more strict (for high-quality, dense data):**
```
0.0 100.0 5.0 10 8 8 50
```
- This will only keep the best-connected, most robust event pairs.

---

## **What to do next:**
1. **Try the recommended values above.**
2. **Rerun ph2dt and check the log for:**
   - Number of “events selected”
   - Number of “phases”
   - Number of “outliers”
   - Number of “linked event pairs”
3. **Adjust further if you still get too few links or too many outliers.**

---

### **Summary Table**

| Parameter | Default | Permissive | Strict  |
|-----------|---------|------------|---------|
| MINWGHT   | 0.0     | 0.0        | 0.0     |
| MAXDIST   | 200.0   | 300–500    | 100     |
| MAXSEP    | 10.0    | 20–50      | 5       |
| MAXNGH    | 10      | 20–30      | 10      |
| MINLNK    | 8       | 2–4        | 8       |
| MINOBS    | 8       | 1–2        | 8       |
| MAXOBS    | 50      | 99         | 50      |

---

**Try the permissive set first:**  
```
0.0 300.0 20.0 20 4 2 99
```
and see if your clusters are better populated and fewer are skipped.

Let me know if you want to tune for a specific scenario or need help interpreting the new ph2dt log!

**User**

Okay, if I want to do a cross correlation, what should I do?

---

**Cursor**

To perform cross-correlation with HypoDD/ph2dt, you need to generate **cross-correlation differential times** (`dt.cc`) in addition to the catalog differential times (`dt.ct`). This is the most powerful feature of HypoDD, as cross-correlation times are much more precise than catalog picks.

Here’s a step-by-step guide tailored to your workflow:

---

## **1. Prepare your waveform data**

- Make sure you have waveform files (e.g., `.mseed`) for all events and stations you want to cross-correlate.
- The waveform files should be accessible and listed in your workflow.

---

## **2. Ensure your picks are accurate**

- The cross-correlation step uses the initial picks (from your QuakeML or phase files) as reference windows for extracting waveforms.
- The better your initial picks, the more successful the cross-correlation.

---

## **3. Configure your Python workflow**

Your `HypoDDRelocator` class already supports cross-correlation.  
The key step is to **add your waveform files** and let the workflow run the cross-correlation step.

**Example:**
```python
relocator.add_waveform_files("/path/to/waveforms/*.mseed")
```
or, if you have a list:
```python
relocator.add_waveform_files(list_of_waveform_files)
```

---

## **4. Set cross-correlation parameters**

When you initialize `HypoDDRelocator`, you can set parameters like:
- `cc_time_before`, `cc_time_after`: Time window around the pick (e.g., 0.05, 0.2 seconds)
- `cc_maxlag`: Maximum lag to test (e.g., 0.1)
- `cc_filter_min_freq`, `cc_filter_max_freq`: Bandpass filter for waveforms (e.g., 1, 20 Hz)
- `cc_p_phase_weighting`, `cc_s_phase_weighting`: Which channels to use and their weights (e.g., `{"Z": 1.0}` for P, `{"Z": 1.0, "E": 1.0, "N": 1.0}` for S)
- `cc_min_allowed_cross_corr_coeff`: Minimum correlation coefficient to accept a result (e.g., 0.6)

**Example:**
```python
relocator = HypoDDRelocator(
    working_dir="hypodd_working",
    cc_time_before=0.05,
    cc_time_after=0.2,
    cc_maxlag=0.1,
    cc_filter_min_freq=1,
    cc_filter_max_freq=20,
    cc_p_phase_weighting={"Z": 1.0},
    cc_s_phase_weighting={"Z": 1.0, "E": 1.0, "N": 1.0},
    cc_min_allowed_cross_corr_coeff=0.6,
)
```

---

## **5. Run the workflow**

- When you call `start_relocation`, the workflow will:
  - Parse events and stations
  - Write input files
  - Run ph2dt
  - **Run cross-correlation and generate `dt.cc`**
  - Run hypoDD

**The cross-correlation step will create a `dt.cc` file in your input directory.**

---

## **6. Check the logs and results**

- After running, check the log for lines like:
  ```
  Finished calculating cross correlations.
  ```
- Check the number of cross-correlation dtimes in the HypoDD log:
  ```
  # cross corr P dtimes = ...
  # cross corr S dtimes = ...
  ```

---

## **7. Troubleshooting**

- If you get `# cross corr P dtimes = 0`, it means no cross-correlation dtimes were generated. This could be due to:
  - No matching waveform files
  - Bad picks
  - Too strict correlation coefficient threshold
  - Wrong channel configuration

---

**User**

I've made lighter neighboring conditions (as you recommended) and uploaded the waveforms for cross-correlation. It still gives me divide by zero error.

---

**Cursor**

Thank you for the detailed update. Here’s a focused analysis and next steps:

---

## **Key Observations from Your Log**

- **# cross corr P dtimes = 0 (no OTC for 0 event pairs)**
- **# cross corr S dtimes = 0 (no OTC for 0 event pairs)**
- **catalog P dtimes = 517**
- **catalog S dtimes = 539**
- **FATAL ERROR (lsqr: G scaling). Please report to felix@andreas.wr.usgs.gov**
- **Floating-point exceptions: divide by zero, overflow, etc.**

---

## **What This Means**

- **No cross-correlation dtimes are being generated** (`dt.cc` is empty or not created).
- **Only catalog dtimes are being used** (`dt.ct`).
- The inversion is **numerically unstable** (matrix is singular or nearly so), likely because:
  - There are too few dtimes per event/cluster.
  - The event-station geometry is poor.
  - The data is too sparse or not well linked.

---

## **Why are there no cross-correlation dtimes?**

### **Possible reasons:**
1. **Waveform files are not being found or matched to picks.**
2. **The cross-correlation window is too small or too large.**
3. **The picks are not accurate enough for the window to contain the phase.**
4. **The channel configuration does not match your data.**
5. **The minimum correlation coefficient is too high.**
6. **The code is not actually running the cross-correlation step.**

---

## **What to check and do next**

### **1. Check the log for cross-correlation step**
- In your Python log (`log.txt`), do you see lines like:
  ```
  Finished calculating cross correlations.
  ```
- Are there any warnings about missing waveform files or traces?

### **2. Check the `dt.cc` file**
- Is `dt.cc` being created in your input directory?
- Is it empty or does it contain data?

### **3. Check waveform file matching**
- Are your waveform files named and organized so that the code can find the correct traces for each pick?
- Do the network and station codes in your picks match those in the waveform files?

### **4. Lower the cross-correlation threshold**
- Try setting `cc_min_allowed_cross_corr_coeff=0.0` to accept all results, just to test.

### **5. Widen the cross-correlation window**
- Try increasing `cc_time_before` and `cc_time_after` (e.g., 0.2 and 0.5 seconds).

### **6. Check channel configuration**
- Make sure your `cc_p_phase_weighting` and `cc_s_phase_weighting` match the channels in your waveform files (e.g., `{"Z": 1.0}` for P, `{"E": 1.0, "N": 1.0, "Z": 1.0}` for S).

### **7. Run only the cross-correlation step for debugging**
- You can run the cross-correlation step alone and inspect the output and logs.

---

## **Example: How to set up for maximum cross-correlation**

```python
relocator = HypoDDRelocator(
    working_dir="hypodd_working",
    cc_time_before=0.2,
    cc_time_after=0.5,
    cc_maxlag=0.2,
    cc_filter_min_freq=1,
    cc_filter_max_freq=20,
    cc_p_phase_weighting={"Z": 1.0},
    cc_s_phase_weighting={"Z": 1.0, "E": 1.0, "N": 1.0},
    cc_min_allowed_cross_corr_coeff=0.0,  # Accept all for testing
)
relocator.add_waveform_files("/path/to/waveforms/*.mseed")
```

---

## **If you want to debug further:**

- **Check the Python log for lines about missing traces or files.**
- **Check the contents of `dt.cc`.**
- **If you want, share a snippet of your log.txt and a listing of your waveform files.**

**If you follow these steps and still get zero cross-corr dtimes, please share:**
- The relevant section of your Python log (around the cross-correlation step)
- The output of `ls -l` for your waveform directory
- A sample pick and a sample waveform filename

I can then help you pinpoint the exact issue!

**User**

As you can youself see the waveform correlation starts, I am not sure what's the problem

---

**Cursor**

You are correct:  
- The workflow **does** parse waveform files and runs the cross-correlation step.
- The log says:
  ```
  >>> Parsing 434 waveform files...
  ...
  >>> Cross correlating arrival times for 119 event_pairs...
  ...
  >>> Finished calculating cross correlations.
  >>> Successfully saved cross correlation results to file: hypodd_cross_correlation_results.json.
  ```
- **But:**  
  ```
  # cross corr P dtimes =       0 (no OTC for      0 event pairs)
  # cross corr S dtimes =       0 (no OTC for      0 event pairs)
  ```

---

## **What does this mean?**

- The cross-correlation code is running, but **no cross-correlation differential times are being produced**.
- This is why HypoDD is still running on catalog dtimes only, and the inversion is unstable.

---

## **What could be wrong?**

### 1. **No matching traces found for picks**
- The code may not be able to find the correct waveform data for the picks (station/network/channel mismatch, wrong time window, etc.).

### 2. **Cross-correlation window is too small/large**
- The window around the pick may not contain the phase, or may be too noisy.

### 3. **Minimum correlation coefficient is too high**
- If set too high, all results may be rejected.

### 4. **Channel configuration mismatch**
- The code may be looking for the wrong channel (e.g., "Z" vs "EHZ" vs "BHZ").

### 5. **Waveform files are not complete or not covering the pick times**
- The waveform files may not actually contain the data for the pick times.

---

## **How to debug further**

### **A. Check the Python log for warnings**
- Look for lines like:
  ```
  No matching Z trace found for ...
  ```
  or
  ```
  Waveform file ... could not be read.
  ```

### **B. Check the contents of `dt.cc`**
- Is it empty or missing? If so, no cross-correlation dtimes were written.

### **C. Lower the correlation threshold**
- Set `cc_min_allowed_cross_corr_coeff=0.0` to accept all results for testing.

### **D. Widen the cross-correlation window**
- Try `cc_time_before=0.5`, `cc_time_after=1.0` (in seconds).

### **E. Check your picks and waveform file naming**
- Do the picks in your QuakeML/phase file have the same network/station/channel codes as your waveform files?
- Are the waveform files named and organized so the code can find them?

### **F. Print debug info in the cross-correlation code**
- Add print/log statements in the `_cross_correlate_picks` method to see:
  - How many picks are being attempted
  - How many fail to find a matching trace
  - What the actual search patterns are

---

## **What to do next**

1. **Check your Python log for warnings about missing traces or files.**
2. **Check if `dt.cc` is created and if it contains any data.**
3. **Try the most permissive cross-correlation settings:**
   ```python
   cc_time_before=0.5
   cc_time_after=1.0
   cc_maxlag=0.5
   cc_min_allowed_cross_corr_coeff=0.0
   ```
4. **Check that your picks and waveform files match in network/station/channel and time.**
5. **If you want, share a few lines from your log.txt around the cross-correlation step, and a listing of your waveform files and a sample pick.**

**User**

dt.cc has 119 strings, However, hypodd_cross_corrlation_results.json is empty somehow..

---

**Cursor**

Excellent observation! Here’s what your files and logs reveal:

---

## **What’s happening?**

- **dt.cc** has 119 event pairs, but every line is like:
  ```
  # 19  32 0.0
  ```
  (i.e., the cross-correlation time is always `0.0`).
- **hypodd_cross_correlation_results.json** is empty (`{}`).
- The log says:
  ```
  Cross correlating arrival times for 119 event_pairs...
  Finished calculating cross correlations.
  Successfully saved cross correlation results to file: hypodd_cross_correlation_results.json.
  ```
- **No warnings or errors are shown in the log.**

---

## **What does this mean?**

- The cross-correlation code is running, but **all cross-correlation results are zero** (no actual time shift measured, or all results are being defaulted to zero).
- The results JSON is empty, which means **no successful cross-correlation results were stored** (likely all were below the threshold or failed).

---

## **Why might this happen?**

### 1. **No valid cross-correlation found**
- The code may be failing to find valid traces for the picks, or the traces are not overlapping with the pick windows.

### 2. **All cross-correlation coefficients are zero or below threshold**
- If the correlation coefficient is always zero (bad data, wrong window, or wrong channel), the code may default to writing `0.0` for the time shift.

### 3. **The code is writing default values for failed pairs**
- If the cross-correlation fails, the code may still write a line with `0.0` as the time shift.

### 4. **No actual cross-correlation is being performed**
- There may be a bug or misconfiguration causing the code to skip the actual cross-correlation calculation.

---

## **How to debug further**

### **A. Add debug prints in the cross-correlation code**
- Print/log the correlation coefficient and time shift for each pair.
- Print/log when a trace is not found or a pair is skipped.

### **B. Lower the correlation threshold to zero**
- You may have already done this, but double-check that `cc_min_allowed_cross_corr_coeff=0.0`.

### **C. Widen the cross-correlation window**
- Try `cc_time_before=1.0`, `cc_time_after=1.0`, `cc_maxlag=1.0`.

### **D. Check the waveform and pick matching**
- Are the picks and waveform files definitely matching in network, station, and time?
- Are the picks within the time range of the waveform files?

### **E. Check for warnings in the log**
- If the code is skipping pairs due to missing traces, you should see warnings. If not, add print/log statements to catch this.

---

## **What to do next**

1. **Add debug output in `_cross_correlate_picks`** to print:
   - The event pair IDs
   - Whether traces were found
   - The correlation coefficient and time shift for each pair

2. **Check if the code is actually performing the cross-correlation, or just writing zeros.**

3. **Check a few picks and waveform files manually:**
   - Does the pick time fall within the time range of the waveform file?
   - Does the station/network/channel match?

**User**

Could you please help me to make a debug pring in cross_correlate_picks?

---

**Cursor**

Absolutely! To debug why your cross-correlation is not producing results, you should add detailed print/log statements inside the `_cross_correlate_picks` method. The best places to add debug output are:

- When a pick pair is found and about to be cross-correlated.
- When a pick pair is skipped (and why).
- When a cross-correlation result is calculated (show the values).
- When a result is discarded due to a low correlation coefficient.

Here’s how you can add debug prints:

---

**Add the following debug prints in `_cross_correlate_picks`:**

1. **Before cross-correlation is attempted:**
   ```python
   print(f"Trying to cross-correlate: Event1={event_1}, Event2={event_2}, Station={pick_1_station_id}, Phase={pick_1_phase}")
   ```

2. **If a pick pair is skipped (no matching pick):**
   ```python
   if pick_2 is None:
       print(f"Skipping: No matching pick for Event2={event_2}, Station={pick_1_station_id}, Phase={pick_1_phase}")
       continue
   ```

3. **After cross-correlation is performed:**
   Just after the call to `xcorr_pick_correction`, add:
   ```python
   print(f"Cross-correlation result: pick2_corr={pick2_corr}, cross_corr_coeff={cross_corr_coeff}")
   ```

4. **If the correlation coefficient is too low:**
   ```python
   if (
       cross_corr_coeff
       < self.cc_param["cc_min_allowed_cross_corr_coeff"]
   ):
       print(f"Discarded due to low correlation: coeff={cross_corr_coeff}")
       continue
   ```

---

Would you like me to insert these debug prints for you in the right places in the code? If so, I can make the edit directly.

```python
   print(f"Trying to cross-correlate: Event1={event_1}, Event2={event_2}, Station={pick_1_station_id}, Phase={pick_1_phase}")
```

```python
   if pick_2 is None:
       print(f"Skipping: No matching pick for Event2={event_2}, Station={pick_1_station_id}, Phase={pick_1_phase}")
       continue
```

```python
   print(f"Cross-correlation result: pick2_corr={pick2_corr}, cross_corr_coeff={cross_corr_coeff}")
```

```python
   if (
       cross_corr_coeff
       < self.cc_param["cc_min_allowed_cross_corr_coeff"]
   ):
       print(f"Discarded due to low correlation: coeff={cross_corr_coeff}")
       continue
```

```

The debug print statements have been added to `_cross_correlate_picks` as requested. Here’s what was inserted:

- When a pick pair is skipped due to no matching pick:
  ```python
  print(f"Skipping: No matching pick for Event2={event_2}, Station={pick_1_station_id}, Phase={pick_1_phase}")
  ```
- When a pick pair is about to be cross-correlated:
  ```python
  print(f"Trying to cross-correlate: Event1={event_1}, Event2={event_2}, Station={pick_1_station_id}, Phase={pick_1_phase}")
  ```
- After cross-correlation is performed:
  ```python
  print(f"Cross-correlation result: pick2_corr={pick2_corr}, cross_corr_coeff={cross_corr_coeff}")
  ```
- When a result is discarded due to low correlation coefficient:
  ```python
  print(f"Discarded due to low correlation: coeff={cross_corr_coeff}")
  ```

You can now rerun your workflow and observe the terminal output to see exactly which pick pairs are being processed, skipped, and what the cross-correlation results are. This should help you pinpoint where and why cross-correlation is failing or producing zeros.

If you need even more detailed output or want to log to a file instead of printing, let me know!

```python
  print(f"Skipping: No matching pick for Event2={event_2}, Station={pick_1_station_id}, Phase={pick_1_phase}")
```

```python
  print(f"Trying to cross-correlate: Event1={event_1}, Event2={event_2}, Station={pick_1_station_id}, Phase={pick_1_phase}")
```

```python
  print(f"Cross-correlation result: pick2_corr={pick2_corr}, cross_corr_coeff={cross_corr_coeff}")
```

```python
  print(f"Discarded due to low correlation: coeff={cross_corr_coeff}")
```

**User**

Okay, does it think that mseed should contain picks? How does this work, could you please tell me?

---

**Cursor**

Great question! Let’s clarify how the cross-correlation process works in your workflow, and what the code expects from your MiniSEED (`.mseed`) files and picks.

---

## **How Cross-Correlation Works in This Code**

### **1. Picks and Event Information**
- **Picks** (arrival times) are read from your QuakeML or other event files.
- Each pick has:
  - A station ID (e.g., `.620`)
  - A phase (e.g., `P`, `S`)
  - A pick time (UTCDateTime)
- The code **does not expect picks to be in the MiniSEED files**. Picks are only read from the event catalog (QuakeML, etc.).

### **2. What the MiniSEED Files Provide**
- The MiniSEED files provide **continuous waveform data** for each station and channel.
- The code uses the pick time to extract a window of waveform data around each pick (using `cc_time_before` and `cc_time_after`).

### **3. What the Code Does for Each Event Pair**
- For each event pair and each matching pick (same station and phase in both events):
  1. **Finds the waveform data** for both picks (from MiniSEED).
  2. **Extracts a window** around each pick time.
  3. **Cross-correlates** the two waveform windows to measure the time shift (differential travel time) and correlation coefficient.
  4. **Stores the result** if the correlation coefficient is above the threshold.

### **4. What Can Go Wrong**
- If the waveform window cannot be found (e.g., no data for that station/time/channel), the pick pair is skipped.
- If the waveform is too noisy, too short, or otherwise unsuitable, the cross-correlation may fail or return a low coefficient.
- If the phase is not `P` or `S` (e.g., `IAML`), the code may not use it for HypoDD, but it still tries to process it if present.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Source         | What it contains         | What the code expects           |
|----------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| QuakeML/event  | Picks (arrival times)   | Yes, for each event/station/phase |
| MiniSEED       | Waveform data           | Yes, continuous data for each station/channel, covering the pick times |

**The code does NOT expect picks in the MiniSEED files.**  
It expects to find waveform data in MiniSEED, and picks in the event catalog.

---

## **What to Check if Cross-Correlation Fails**
- **Are your MiniSEED files complete?** (Do they cover the pick times for all stations/channels?)
- **Are the picks in your event catalog correct and match the station/channel naming in the MiniSEED?)
- **Are the waveform windows extracted around the picks valid (not too short, not all zeros, etc.)?**
- **Are you using only `P` and `S` phases for relocation?** (Other phases like `IAML` are not standard for HypoDD.)

---

If you want to debug further, you can:
- Check the waveform extraction step (does it find the right data?).
- Check the actual waveform windows being cross-correlated (are they valid?).
- Check the correlation coefficients (are they always low?).

If you want, I can help you add even more detailed debug output to see exactly what waveform windows are being used, or help you filter out non-`P`/`S` phases. Let me know how you’d like to proceed!

---

**User**

I am mostly worried about the matching of station/channel naming in the miniseed. Could you please add the debug print to the hypodd_relocator.py for us to understand what is happening and is there a mismatch.. Please add the verbose flag and set it to true right now.

```

The code now includes a `verbose` flag (set to `True` by default) in the `HypoDDRelocator` class. In the `_cross_correlate_picks` method, detailed debug print statements have been added. These will:

- Print the station/channel IDs being searched for in the MiniSEED files.
- Show the available keys in `self.waveform_information`.
- Display which data files are found for each pick.
- Show which traces are selected for each channel.

This will help you diagnose any mismatches between the station/channel naming in your picks and the MiniSEED files. You should now see `[VERBOSE]` debug output in your console when running the cross-correlation step, making it much easier to spot where things might not be matching up.

If you want to reduce the verbosity later, you can set `verbose=False` when initializing `HypoDDRelocator`. For now, run your workflow and inspect the debug output to identify any mismatches or missing data. If you need help interpreting the output, just share a snippet!

---

**User**

I think now we have a clearer pickture of what's happening. There seem to be no data files. What does that mean?

---

**Cursor**

You are correct: the debug output shows that for every pick, the data files returned are `False` for both `pick_1` and `pick_2`. This means that the `_find_data` method is **not finding any waveform files** that match the requested station, time, and duration.

### What does this mean?

- **No waveform data is being found for the picks.**
- As a result, no cross-correlation can be performed, and all cross-correlation results are empty or zero.

---

## Why is this happening?

Let's break down the likely causes:

### 1. **Station ID Mismatch**
- Your picks have station IDs like `.631`, `.621`, etc.
- Your waveform keys are like `SI.631.LC.00E`, `SI.631.LC.00N`, etc.
- The `_find_data` function tries to match station IDs using patterns, but if the pick's station ID is just `.631`, it will not match `SI.631.LC.00E` (because the pattern is `*.631.*.*[E,N,Z,1,2,3]`).

### 2. **Time Window Mismatch**
- Even if the station/channel pattern matched, if the waveform file's time window does not cover the pick time ± window, it will be skipped.

### 3. **No Waveform Files Loaded**
- If the waveform files were not loaded or parsed correctly, the `waveform_information` dictionary would be empty or incomplete.

---

## How to fix this

### **A. Fix the Station ID Construction**

- Your picks should have station IDs that match the waveform keys' format.
- Instead of `.631`, the pick's station ID should be `SI.631` (matching the network and station code).
- Check how the station ID is constructed in `_read_event_information`:
  ```python
  current_pick["station_id"] = "{}.{}".format(
      pick.waveform_id.network_code,
      pick.waveform_id.station_code,
  )
  ```
  If `network_code` is empty or missing, you get `.631` instead of `SI.631`.

**Solution:**  
- Ensure that your QuakeML picks have the correct `network_code` set.
- Or, in your code, if `network_code` is empty, try to infer it or default to `SI`.

### **B. Check the Time Windows**

- Make sure your waveform files actually cover the pick times ± the cross-correlation window.

### **C. Confirm Waveform Files Are Loaded**

- The debug output shows many keys in `waveform_information`, so files are being loaded, but double-check that all expected files are present.

---

## **What to do next**

1. **Print the actual pick station IDs and their network codes** in `_read_event_information` to see if they are being set correctly.
2. **Adjust the code** so that the station IDs in picks match the waveform keys (e.g., `SI.631`).
3. **Rerun the workflow** and check if data files are now found.

Would you like me to update the code to ensure the station IDs always include the network code (e.g., `SI.631`), or to add more debug output to help you diagnose this further?

```python
  current_pick["station_id"] = "{}.{}".format(
      pick.waveform_id.network_code,
      pick.waveform_id.station_code,
  )
```

---

**User**

I've added the SI network code to the pick, but I get the same errors((

---

**Cursor**

You're on the right track by ensuring the picks have the `SI` network code, but the debug output still shows that the code is looking for data for station IDs like `.631` and `.621` (with a leading dot), not `SI.631` or `SI.621`. This is why the pattern matching in `_find_data` is failing, even though your waveform keys are like `SI.631.LC.00E`.

### Why is this happening?

Let's look at the relevant code:
```python
current_pick["station_id"] = "{}.{}".format(
    pick.waveform_id.network_code if pick.waveform_id.network_code else "SI",
    pick.waveform_id.station_code,
)
if len(current_pick["station_id"]) > 7:
    current_pick["station_id"] = pick.waveform_id.station_code
```
- If the combined string is longer than 7 characters, it **removes the network code** and just uses the station code (e.g., `631`), which is not what you want.
- This is why you end up with `.631` or `.621` as station IDs in your picks, which do **not** match the waveform keys.

---

## **How to fix it**

**Remove or adjust this logic:**
```python
if len(current_pick["station_id"]) > 7:
    current_pick["station_id"] = pick.waveform_id.station_code
```
- This line is not needed for your data and is causing the mismatch.
- You want the station ID to always be `SI.631`, `SI.621`, etc.

---

## **What to do**

1. **Delete or comment out the `if len(current_pick["station_id"]) > 7:` block** in `_read_event_information`.
2. **Regenerate your events and rerun the workflow.**

This will ensure that the picks' `station_id` always matches the waveform keys, and `_find_data` will be able to find the correct files.

---

### **Would you like me to make this change for you?**  
It will only take a moment and should resolve the data file matching issue!

```python
current_pick["station_id"] = "{}.{}".format(
    pick.waveform_id.network_code if pick.waveform_id.network_code else "SI",
    pick.waveform_id.station_code,
)
if len(current_pick["station_id"]) > 7:
    current_pick["station_id"] = pick.waveform_id.station_code
```

```python
if len(current_pick["station_id"]) > 7:
    current_pick["station_id"] = pick.waveform_id.station_code
```

---

**User**

Yes, please, can you do it?

---

**Cursor**

```python
// ... existing code ...
                current_pick["station_id"] = "{}.{}".format(
                    pick.waveform_id.network_code if pick.waveform_id.network_code else "SI",
                    pick.waveform_id.station_code,
                )
                // ... existing code ...
                # Remove this block:
                # if len(current_pick["station_id"]) > 7:
                #     current_pick["station_id"] = pick.waveform_id.station_code
                current_pick["phase"] = pick.phase_hint
// ... existing code ...
```

The code has been updated so that the `station_id` for each pick will **always** be in the `network.station` format (e.g., `SI.631`), and it will no longer strip the network code based on length.

This should resolve the mismatch between your picks and the waveform keys, allowing `_find_data` to locate the correct MiniSEED files for cross-correlation.

**Next steps:**
- Rerun your workflow.
- Check the `[VERBOSE]` debug output to confirm that the `station_id` being searched for now matches the keys in `waveform_information`.
- You should start seeing data files being found for your picks.

If you still encounter issues, please share the new debug output!

                current_pick["phase"] = pick.phase_hint
// ... existing code ...
```

The code has been reverted:  
- The logic now **restores the previous behavior**—if the constructed `station_id` (network.station) is longer than 7 characters, it uses only the station code (e.g., `631`) as the `station_id`.

This should allow `ph2dt` to work as before, since your `station.dat` and picks will again use the short station code format.

You can now rerun your workflow and `ph2dt` should function as it did previously. If you want to try a more robust solution for cross-correlation and waveform matching in the future, let me know!

Now can we make *REALLY* clear debug print in the hypodd_relocator? Like we *need* to know where exactly the mismatch happends, is it really the network code that's stoping it or something else. We need to be thorough to make sure.

Perfect! The comprehensive debug prints have been added to both key methods:

## **In `_read_event_information`:**
- Shows the exact `network_code` and `station_code` from each pick
- Shows the constructed `station_id` and its length
- Shows the final `station_id` after the length check (if it gets truncated)

## **In `_find_data`:**
- Shows the exact `station_id` being searched for
- Shows the time window being requested
- Shows the pattern being used to match waveform keys
- Shows which keys actually match the pattern
- Shows the final list of filenames found (or False if none)

Now when you run your workflow, you'll see **exactly** where the mismatch occurs:

1. **During event reading:** You'll see if the picks have the right network/station codes
2. **During cross-correlation:** You'll see exactly what `station_id` is being used to search for data
3. **During data finding:** You'll see the pattern matching logic and whether it finds any files

This will definitively show you whether:
- The issue is in the pick construction (network codes missing/wrong)
- The issue is in the pattern matching (station_id format vs waveform keys)
- The issue is in the time windows (no data covering the requested times)

Run your workflow now and share the verbose output - we'll be able to pinpoint exactly where the problem is!

**User**

Okay, now does this help us? We know that constructed station_id = 'SI.628'. so what?

---

**Cursor**

Excellent! Now we can see the **exact problem**:

## **What the debug output shows:**

1. **Your picks have `network_code: ''` (empty)** - this is why the code defaults to `'SI'`
2. **Your picks have `station_code: '628'`** - this is correct
3. **The constructed `station_id` is `'SI.628'`** - this should work
4. **The length is 6** - so it doesn't get truncated

## **The issue is now clear:**

Your **waveform keys** are like `'SI.628.LC.00E'`, but your **pick station_id** is `'SI.628'`.

When `_find_data` tries to match:
- **Pattern:** `'SI.628.*.*[E,N,Z,1,2,3]'` 
- **Available keys:** `'SI.628.LC.00E'`, `'SI.628.LC.00N'`, `'SI.628.LC.00Z'`

**This should work!** The pattern `'SI.628.*.*[E,N,Z,1,2,3]'` should match `'SI.628.LC.00E'`.

---

## **Let's see the cross-correlation debug output:**

Run your workflow and look for the `[VERBOSE] _find_data called with:` output. This will show us:

1. **What `station_id` is being passed to `_find_data`**
2. **What pattern is being used**
3. **Which keys actually match**

**The key question:** Are you seeing `station_id: 'SI.628'` in the cross-correlation step, or is it still showing `station_id: '.628'`?

If it's still showing `.628`, then there's a mismatch between what's stored in the events and what's being used in cross-correlation. If it's showing `SI.628`, then the pattern matching should work.

**Please share the cross-correlation debug output so we can see exactly what's happening in `_find_data`!**
